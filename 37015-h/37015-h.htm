<h1>CAROLYN OF THE CORNERS</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—THE RAY OF SUNLIGHT</h2>
<p>
Just as the rays of the afternoon sun hesitated
to enter the open door of Joseph Stagg’s hardware
store in Sunrise Cove, and lingered on
the sill, so the little girl in the black frock and hat,
with twin braids of sunshiny hair on her shoulders,
hovered at the entrance of the dim and dusty place.
</p>
<p>
She carried a satchel in one hand, while the fingers
of the other were hooked into the rivet-studded collar
of a mottled, homely mongrel dog, who likewise
looked curiously into the dusky interior of Mr.
Stagg’s shop, and whose abbreviated tail quivered
expectantly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, Prince!” sighed the little girl,
“this must be the place. We’ll just <em>have</em> to go in.
Of course, I know he must be a nice man; but he’s
<em>such</em> a stranger!”
</p>
<p>
She sighed again; but Prince whined eagerly. He
seemed much more sanguine of a welcome than did
his mistress. Her feet faltered over the doorsill and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
paced slowly down the shop between the long counters,
each step slower than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
She saw no clerk; only the littered counters, the
glass-enclosed showcases, the low bins of nails and
bolts on either hand, and the high shelves filled with
innumerable boxes, on the end of each of which was
a sample piece of hardware.
</p>
<p>
At the back of the shop was a small office closed
in with grimy windows. There was not much light
there. The uncertain visitor and her canine companion
saw the shadowy figure of a man inside the
office, sitting on a high stool and bent above a big
ledger.
</p>
<p>
The dog, however, scented something else. The
hair on his neck began to bristle, and he sniffed
inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
In the half darkness of the shop he and his little
mistress came unexpectedly upon what Prince considered
his arch-enemy. There rose up on the end
of the counter nearest the open office door a big,
black tom-cat whose arched back, swollen tail, and
yellow eyes blazing defiance, proclaimed his readiness
to give battle to the quivering dog.
</p>
<p>
“Ps-s-st—ye-ow!”
</p>
<p>
The rising yowl broke the silence of the shop like
a trumpet-call. The little girl dropped her bag and
seized the dog’s collar with both hands.
</p>
<p>
“Prince!” she cried, “don’t you speak to that
cat—don’t you <em>dare</em> speak to it!”
</p>
<p>
The dog quivered all over in an ague of desire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
The instincts of the chase possessed his doggish soul,
but his little mistress’ word was law to him.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” croaked a voice from the office.
</p>
<p>
The tom-cat uttered a second “ps-s-st—ye-ow!”
and shot up a ladder to the top shelf, from which
vantage he looked down, showering insults on his
enemy in a low and threatening tone.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” repeated Joseph Stagg, taking off
his eyeglasses and leaving them in the ledger to
mark his place. “What have you brought that dog
in here for?”
</p>
<p>
He came to the office door. Without his glasses,
and with the girl standing between him and the light,
Mr. Stagg squinted a little to see her, stooping, with
his hands on his knees.
</p>
<p>
“I—I didn’t have any place to leave him,” was
the hesitating reply to the rather petulant query.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! Did your mother send you for something?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o, sir,” sighed the little visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Your father wants something, then?” questioned
the puzzled hardware dealer.
</p>
<p>
“No-o, sir.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment a more daring ray of sunlight
found its way through the transom over the store
door and lit up the dusky place. It fell upon the
slight, black-frocked figure and, for the instant,
touched the pretty head as with an aureole.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, child!” exclaimed Mr. Stagg. “Who
are you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
The flowerlike face of the little girl quivered, the
blue eyes spilled big drops over her cheeks. She
approached Mr. Stagg, stooping and squinting in
the office doorway, and placed a timid hand upon
the broad band of black crêpe he wore on his coat
sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not Hannah’s Car’lyn?” questioned the
hardware dealer huskily.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Car’lyn May Cameron,” she confessed.
“You’re my Uncle Joe. I’m very glad to see you,
Uncle Joe, and—and I hope—you’re glad to see
me—and Prince,” she finished rather falteringly.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” murmured the man again, leaning
for support against the door frame.
</p>
<p>
Nothing so startling as this had entered Sunrise
Cove’s chief “hardware emporium,” as Mr. Stagg’s
standing advertisement read in the <em>Weekly Bugle</em>,
for many and many a year.
</p>
<p>
Hannah Stagg, the hardware merchant’s only sister,
had gone away from home quite fifteen years
previously. Mr. Stagg had never seen Hannah
again; but this slight, blue-eyed, sunny-haired girl
was a replica of his sister, and in some dusty corner
of Mr. Stagg’s heart there dwelt a very faithful
memory of Hannah.
</p>
<p>
Nothing had served to estrange the brother and
sister save time and distance. Hannah had been a
patient correspondent, and Joseph Stagg had always
acknowledged the receipt of her letters in a business-like
way, if with brevity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“<span class='sc'>Dear Hannah</span>:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yours of the 12th inst. to hand and contents
noted. Glad to learn of your continued good health
and that of your family, this leaving me in the same
condition.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Yours to command,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>J. Stagg.</span>”</p>
<p>
The hardware merchant was fully as sentimental
as the above letter indicated. If there were drops
now in his eyes as he stooped and squinted at his
little niece, it was because the sunlight was shining
in his face and interfered for the moment with his
vision.
</p>
<p>
“Hannah’s Car’lyn,” muttered Mr. Stagg again.
“Bless me, child! how did you get here from New
York?”
</p>
<p>
“On the cars, uncle.” Carolyn May was glad
he asked that question instead of saying anything
just then about her mother and father.
</p>
<p>
“You see, Mr. Price thought I’d better come.
He says you are my guardian—it’s in papa’s will,
and would have been so in mamma’s will, if she’d
made one. Mr. Price put me on the train and the
conductor took care of me. Only, I rode ’most all
the way with Prince in the baggage car. You see, he
howled so.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg looked askance at the dog, that yawned,
smiled at him, and cocked his cropped ears.
</p>
<p>
“Who is Mr. Price?” the storekeeper asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“He’s a lawyer. He and his family live in the
flat right across the hall from us. He’s written you
a long letter about it. It’s in my bag. Didn’t you
get the telegram he sent you last evening, Uncle
Joe? A ‘night letter,’ he called it.”
</p>
<p>
“Never got it,” replied Mr. Stagg shortly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, when papa and mamma had to go
away so suddenly, they left me with the Prices. I
go to school with Edna Price, and she slept with me
at night in our flat—after the <em>Dunraven</em> sailed.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but what did this lawyer send you up here
for?” asked Mr. Stagg, still with an eye on the dog.
</p>
<p>
The question was a poser, and Carolyn May stammered:
“I—I—Don’t guardians <em>always</em> take their
little girls home and look out for them?”
</p>
<p>
“Hum, I don’t know.” The hardware merchant
mused grimly. “But if your father left a will—However,
I suppose I shall learn all about it in that
lawyer’s letter.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir!” the child said, hastily turning
to open the bag. But he interposed:
</p>
<p>
“We’ll wait about that, Car’lyn May. I—I guess
we’d better go up to The Corners and see what
Aunty Rose has to say about it. You understand, I
couldn’t really keep you if she says ‘No!’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe! couldn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” he declared, wagging his head decidedly.
“And what she’ll say to that dog——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh” Carolyn May cried again, and put both
arms suddenly about the neck of her canine friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
“Prince is just the <em>best</em> dog, Uncle Joe. He never
quarrels, and he’s almost always got a pleasant smile.
He’s a universal fav’rite.”
</p>
<p>
Prince yawned again, showing two perfect rows
of wolflike teeth. Mr. Stagg cast a glance upward
at the perturbed tom-cat.
</p>
<p>
“I can see he’s a favourite with old Jimmy,” he
said with added grimness.
</p>
<p>
It must be confessed that Carolyn May was nervous
about Prince. She was eager to explain.
</p>
<p>
“You see, we’ve had him a dreadfully long time.
Papa and I were taking a walk on a Sunday morning.
We ’most always did, for that’s all the time papa
had away from his work. And we walked down
towards the Harlem River—and what do you <em>s’pose</em>,
Uncle Joe? A man was carrying Prince—he was
just a little puppy, not long got over being blind.
And the man was going to drown him!”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Stagg reflectively, still eyeing
the dog, “it could not have been his beauty that
saved him from a watery grave.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, uncle! I think he’s real beautiful, even if
he is a mongorel,” sighed Carolyn May. “Anyway,
papa bought him from the man for a quarter, and
Prince has been mine ever since.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg shook his head doubtfully. Then he
went into the office and shut the big ledger into the
safe. After locking the safe door, he slipped the
key into his trousers pocket, and glanced around
the store.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know where that useless Gormley boy
is now. If I ever happen to want him,” muttered
Mr. Stagg, “he ain’t in sight nor sound. And if I
don’t want him, he’s right under foot.”
</p>
<p>
“Chet! Hey! you Chet!”
</p>
<p>
To Carolyn May’s amazement and to the utter
mystification of Prince, a section of the floor under
their feet began to rise.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy me!” squealed the little girl, and
she hopped off the trapdoor; but the dog uttered a
quick, threatening growl, and put his muzzle to the
widening aperture.
</p>
<p>
“Hey! call off that dog!” begged a muffled voice
from under the trapdoor. “He’ll eat me up, Mr.
Stagg.”
</p>
<p>
“Lie down, Prince!” commanded Carolyn May
hastily. “It’s only a boy. You know you <em>like</em> boys,
Prince,” she urged.
</p>
<p>
“I sh’d think he did like ’em. Likes to eat ’em,
don’t he?” drawled the lanky, flaxen-haired youth
who gradually came into view through the opening
trap. “Hey, Mr. Stagg, don’t they call dogs ‘man’s
cayenne friend’? And there sure is some pep to
this one. You got a tight hold on his collar, sissy?”
</p>
<p>
“Come on up out o’ that cellar, Chet. I’m going
up to The Corners with my little niece—Hannah’s
Car’lyn. This is Chetwood Gormley. If he ever
stops growin’ longitudinally, mebbe he’ll be a man
some day, and not a giant. You stay right here and
tend store while I’m gone, Chet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May could not help feeling some surprise
at the finally revealed proportions of Chetwood
Gormley. He was lathlike and gawky, with very
prominent upper front teeth, which gave a sort of
bow-window appearance to his wide mouth. But
there was a good-humoured twinkle in the overgrown
boy’s shallow eyes; and, if uncouth, he was kind.
</p>
<p>
“I’m proud to know ye, Car’lyn,” he said. He
stepped quickly out of the way of Prince when the
latter started for the front of the store. “Just
whisper to your cayenne friend that I’m one of the
family, will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Prince wouldn’t bite,” laughed the little girl
gaily.
</p>
<p>
“Then he’s got a lot of perfectly useless teeth,
hasn’t he?” suggested Chetwood.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no——” commenced the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, now,” said Mr. Stagg with some impatience,
and led the way to the door.
</p>
<p>
Prince paced sedately along by Carolyn May’s
side. Once out of the shop in the sunlit street, the
little girl breathed a sigh of relief. Mr. Stagg, peering
down at her sharply, asked:
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I—Your shop is awful dark, Uncle Joe,”
she confessed. “I can’t seem to <em>look up</em> in there.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Look up’?” repeated the hardware dealer,
puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. My papa says never to get in any
place where you can’t <em>look up</em> and see something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
brighter and better ahead,” said Carolyn May softly.
“He says that’s what makes life worth living.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! he does, does he?” grunted Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
He noticed the heavy bag in her hand and took it
from her. Instantly her released fingers stole into
his free hand. Mr. Stagg looked down at the little
hand on his palm, somewhat startled and not a little
dismayed. To Carolyn May it was the most natural
thing in the world to clasp hands with Uncle Joe as
they walked, but it actually made the hardware
dealer blush!
</p>
<p>
The main street of Sunrise Cove on this warm
afternoon was not thronged with shoppers. Not
many people noticed the tall, shambling, round-shouldered
man in rusty black, with the petite figure of the
child and the mongrel dog passing that way, though
a few idle shopkeepers looked after the trio in surprise.
But when Mr. Stagg and his companions
turned into the pleasantly shaded street that led out
of town towards The Corners—where was the Stagg
homestead—Carolyn May noticed her uncle become
suddenly flustered. She saw the blood flood into his
face and neck, and she felt his hand loosen as though
to release her own. The little girl looked ahead
curiously at the woman who was approaching.
</p>
<p>
She was not a young woman—that is, not what
the child would call young. Carolyn May thought
she was very nice looking—tall and robust. She
had beautiful brown hair, and a brown complexion,
with a golden-red colour in her cheeks like that of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
russet apple. Her brown eyes flashed an inquiring
glance upon Carolyn May, but she did not look at
Mr. Stagg, nor did Mr. Stagg look at her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! who <em>is</em> that lady, Uncle Joe?” asked the
little girl when they were out of earshot.
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” Her uncle’s throat seemed to need
clearing. “That—<em>that</em> is Mandy Parlow—<em>Miss</em>
Amanda Parlow,” he corrected himself with dignity.
</p>
<p>
The flush did not soon fade out of his face as they
went on in silence.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—AN OLD-FASHIONED ROSE</h2>
<p>
The street was slightly rising. The pleasant-looking
houses on either hand had pretty
lawns and gardens about them. Carolyn
May Cameron thought Sunrise Cove a very lovely
place—as was quite natural to a child brought up
in the city.
</p>
<p>
Prince approved of the freedom of the street, too.
A cat crossed slowly and with dignity from curb to
curb ahead of them, and the dog almost forgot his
manners.
</p>
<p>
“Here!” exclaimed Mr. Stagg sharply.
“Haven’t you a leash for that mongrel? If we’ve
got to take him along——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, Uncle Joe,” Carolyn May hastened to
assure him. “There’s a strap in my bag—right on
top of the other things. <em>Do</em> let me get it. You see,
Prince has had trouble with cats; they worry him.”
</p>
<p>
“Looks to me,” grunted Mr. Stagg, “as though
he’d like to worry them. What Aunty Rose will say
to that mongrel——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed the little girl. This
“Aunty Rose” he spoke of must be a regular
ogress! Carolyn May had opened the bag and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
found the strong strap, and now she snapped it into
the ring of Prince’s collar. “You’ll just <em>have</em> to be
good, now, you darling old dear!” she whispered
to him.
</p>
<p>
It was half a mile from Main Street to The
Corners. There was tall timber all about Sunrise
Cove, which was built along the shore of a deep
inlet cutting in from the great lake, whose blue
waters sparkled as far as one might see towards the
south and west.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe assured Carolyn May, when she asked
him, that from the highest hill in sight one could
see only the lake and the forest-clothed hills and
valleys. Why, there was not a brick house anywhere!
</p>
<p>
“We don’t have any apartment houses, or janitors,
or gas and electricity up here,” said Mr. Stagg
grimly. “But there’s lumber camps all about.
Mebbe they’ll interest you. Lots of building going
on all the time, too. Sunrise Cove is growing, but
it isn’t very citified yet.”
</p>
<p>
He told her, as they went along, of the long trains
of cars and of the strings of barges going out of
the Cove, all laden with timber and sawed boards,
millstuff, ties, and telegraph poles.
</p>
<p>
They came to the last house in the row of dwellings
on this street, on the very edge of the town.
Carolyn May saw that attached to the house was a
smaller building, facing the roadway, with a wide-open
door, through which she glimpsed benches and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
sawed lumber, while to her nostrils was wafted a
most delicious smell of shavings.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there’s a carpenter shop!” exclaimed Carolyn
May. “And is that the carpenter, Uncle Joe?”
</p>
<p>
A tall old man, lean-faced and closely shaven, with
a hawk’s-beak nose straddled by a huge pair of silver-bowed
spectacles, came out of the shop at that
moment, a jack-plane in his hand. He saw Mr.
Stagg and, turning sharply on his heel, went indoors
again.
</p>
<p>
“Who is he, Uncle Joe?” repeated the little
girl. “And, if I asked him, do you s’pose he’d give
me some of those nice, long, curly shavings?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Jed Parlow—and he <em>wouldn’t</em> give you
any shavings; especially after having seen you with
me,” said the hardware merchant brusquely.
</p>
<p>
The pretty lady whose name was Parlow and the
queer-looking old carpenter, whose name was likewise
Parlow, would neither look at Uncle Joe!
Even such a little girl as Carolyn May could see
that her uncle and the Parlows were not friendly.
It puzzled her, but she did not feel that she could
ask Uncle Joe about it. So she trudged by his side,
holding to his hand and to the dog’s leash.
</p>
<p>
The street soon became a country road, and there
were now no passers-by. A half-cleared forest lay
on either hand—rough pasture land. By-and-by
they came in sight of The Corners—a place where
another road crossed this one at right angles. Both
were wide roads, and a little green park had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
left in the middle of the way at their intersection,
around which was a rusty iron railing.
</p>
<p>
In one corner was a white church with a square
tower and green blinds. This was railed around by
rusty iron pipe, as was the graveyard behind it. At
one side was a row of open horse sheds. In another
of the four corners was set a big store, with a covered
porch all across the front, on which were sheltered
certain agricultural tools, as well as a row of
more or less decrepit chairs—at this hour of the day
unoccupied.
</p>
<p>
A couple of country wagons stood before the
store, but there was no sound of life at The Corners
save a rhythmic “clank, clank, clank” from the
blacksmith shop on the third corner. Carolyn May
had a glimpse of a black-faced man in a red shirt
and a leather apron, and with hairy arms, striking
the sparks from a rosy iron on the anvil next the
forge, the dull glow of the forge fire making a background
for this portrait of “The Village Blacksmith.”
</p>
<p>
On the fourth corner of the crossroads stood the
Stagg homestead—a wide, low-roofed house of
ancient appearance, yet in good repair. The grass
was lush under the wide-spreading maples in the
front yard, and the keys which had fallen from these
trees were carefully brushed into heaps on the brick
walk for removal. Neatness was the keynote of all
about the place.
</p>
<p>
“Is <em>this</em> where you live, Uncle Joe?” asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
Carolyn May breathlessly. “Oh, what a beautiful
big place! Aren’t there any other families with
flats here, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me! No, child,” returned the hardware
dealer. “I never noticed the house was any too big
for one family.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said the little girl, “it isn’t so <em>tall</em>;
but it’s ’most as long as a whole block of houses in
the city. One of the short blocks, I mean. My papa
said seven of the crosstown blocks made a mile, and
twenty of the short blocks. So this house must be
’most a twentieth of a mile long, Uncle Joe. It
seems awful big for <em>me</em> to live in!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg had halted at the gate, and now looked
down upon Carolyn May with perplexed brow.
“Well, we’ve got to see about that first,” he muttered.
“There’s Aunty Rose——”
</p>
<p>
A voice calling, “Chuck! Chuck! Chuck-a-chuck!”
came from behind the old house. A few
white-feathered fowls that had been in sight scurried
wildly away in answer to the summons.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg, still looking at the little girl, set down
the bag and reached for the dog’s leash. The loop
of the latter he passed around the gatepost.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you what it is, Car’lyn May. You’d better
meet Aunty Rose first alone. I’ve my fears about
this mongrel.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe!” quavered his niece.
</p>
<p>
“You go ahead and get acquainted with her,”
urged Mr. Stagg. “She don’t like dogs. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
chase her chickens and run over her flower-beds.
Aunty Rose is peculiar, I might say.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe!” repeated the little girl faintly.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to make her like you, if you want to
live here,” the hardware dealer concluded firmly;
“and that’s all there is to it.”
</p>
<p>
He gave Carolyn May a little shove up the path,
and then stood back and mopped his brow with his
handkerchief. Prince strained at the leash and
whined, wishing to follow his little mistress.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg said: “You’d better keep mighty quiet,
dog. If you want your home address to be The
Corners, sing small!”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not hear this, but disappeared
after the fowls around the corner of the wide, vine-draped
porch. The pleasant back yard was full of
sunshine. On the gravel path beyond the old well,
with its long sweep and bucket, half a hundred chickens,
some guineas, and a flock of turkeys scuffled for
grain which was being thrown to them from an
open pan.
</p>
<p>
That pan was held in the plump hand of a
very dignified-looking woman, dressed in drab, and
with a sunbonnet on her head. Her voluminous
skirt blew about her tall figure; she was plump, but
very upright; her cheeks were rosy; her spectacles
sparkled; and her full lips were puckered into a
matrix for the mellow call:
</p>
<p>
“Chuck! Chuck! Chuck-a-chuck!”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose’s appearance smote the little girl with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
a feeling of awe. Her bonnet was so stiffly starched,
the line of her old-fashioned stays across her plump
shoulders was as unequivocal as a confession of faith.
And when she turned her face to the child, the latter,
young as she was, knew that the woman’s attitude to
all the world was despotic.
</p>
<p>
There was no frown on her face; it was only calm,
unruffled, unemotional. It simply seemed as though
nothing, either material or spiritual, could ruffle the
placidity of Aunty Rose Kennedy.
</p>
<p>
She came of Quaker stock, and the serenity of
body and spirit taught by the sect built a wall between
her and everybody else. At least, so it seemed to
Carolyn May. And when Aunty Rose first looked
at her, she seemed to the child to be merely peering
over that wall. The little girl could not get close
enough to the woman to “snuggle up.”
</p>
<p>
“Child, who are you?” asked Aunty Rose with
some curiosity.
</p>
<p>
The little girl told her name; but perhaps it was
her black frock and hat that identified her in Aunty
Rose’s mind, after all.
</p>
<p>
“You are Hannah Stagg’s little girl,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m—if you please,” Carolyn May confessed
faintly.
</p>
<p>
“And how came you here alone?”
</p>
<p>
“If you please, Uncle Joe said I’d better prob’ly
come ahead and get acquainted with you first.”
</p>
<p>
“‘First’? What do you mean, ‘first’?” asked
Aunty Rose sternly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
“First—before you saw Prince,” responded the
perfectly frank little girl. “Uncle Joe thought
maybe you wouldn’t care for dogs.”
</p>
<p>
“Dogs!”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am. And, of course, where I live,
Prince has to live, too. So——”
</p>
<p>
“So you brought the dog?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Aunty Rose composedly, “I
expected you to come here. I do not know what
Joseph Stagg expected. But I did not suppose you
would have a dog. Where is Joseph Stagg?”
</p>
<p>
“He—he’s coming.”
</p>
<p>
“With the dog?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose seemed to take some time to digest
this; but she made no further comment in regard to
the matter, only saying:
</p>
<p>
“Let us go into the house, Car’lyn May. You
must take off your hat and bathe your face and
hands.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May Cameron followed the stately figure
of Aunty Rose Kennedy into the blue-and-white
kitchen of the old house, with something of the feelings
of a culprit on the way to the block.
</p>
<p>
Such a big kitchen as it was! The little girl
thought it must be almost as big as their whole apartment
in Harlem “put together”—and they had a
tiny private hall, too. There was a great, deep,
enameled sink, with hot and cold water faucets over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
it, and a big, shiny, corrugated drainboard beside it.
Evidently Aunty Rose was not dependent upon the
old well in the yard for her water supply.
</p>
<p>
There was a shining copper boiler, and a great
range, and set tubs of stone, and a big dresser, and a
kitchen cabinet. The walls were covered with tile
paper and the floor with linoleum, and there were
plenty of braided mats about to make the room seem
livable. At the cooler end of the kitchen the supper
table was already set—for three.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” mused the little girl, “she must have suspected
me,” and a warmer glow filtered into the
heart of the “suspected” guest.
</p>
<p>
It was not till afterwards that she realised that
the extra plate on the table was a part of the old-time
Quaker creed—the service for the Unknown
Guest.
</p>
<p>
“Used to make me feel right spooky when she
first came here,” Mr. Stagg sometimes said, “but I
got used to it. And it does seem hospitable.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl took off her plain black hat, shook
back her hair, and patted it smooth with her hands,
then plunged her hands and face into the basin of
cool water Aunty Rose had drawn for her at the
sink. The dust was all washed away and a fresh
glow came into her flowerlike face. Aunty Rose
watched her silently.
</p>
<p>
Such a dignified, upright, unresponsive woman as
she seemed standing there! And so particular, neat,
and immaculate was this kitchen!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May, as she dried her face and hands,
heard a familiar whine at the door. It was Prince.
She wondered if she had at all broken the ice for him
with Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” the little girl mused, “I wonder what she
will say to a mongorel.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—GOING TO BED</h2>
<p>
Mr. Stagg had fastened Prince’s strap to
the porch rail, and he now came in with
the bag.
</p>
<p>
“Is that all the child’s baggage, Joseph Stagg?”
asked Aunty Rose, taking it from his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, I never thought to ask her,” the
man admitted. “Have you a trunk check, Car’lyn?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“They sent you up here with only that bag?”
Mr. Stagg said with some exasperation. “Haven’t
you got any clothes but those you stand in?”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Price said—said they weren’t suitable,”
explained the little girl. “You see, they aren’t
black.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exploded her uncle.
</p>
<p>
“You greatly lack tact, Joseph Stagg,” said
Aunty Rose, and the hardware dealer cleared his
throat loudly as he went to the sink to perform his
pre-supper ablutions. Carolyn May did not understand
just what the woman meant.
</p>
<p>
“Ahem!” said Uncle Joe gruffly. “S’pose I
ought t’ve read that letter before. What’s come of
it, Car’lyn May?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
But just then the little girl was so deeply interested
in what Aunty Rose was doing that she failed to hear
him. Mrs. Kennedy brought out of the pantry a tin
pie plate, on which were scraps of meat and bread,
besides a goodly marrow bone.
</p>
<p>
“If you think the dog is hungry, Car’lyn May,”
she said, “you would better give him this before we
break our fast.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty Rose!” gasped the little girl, her
sober face all a-smile. “He’ll be de-<em>light</em>-ed.”
</p>
<p>
She carried the pan out to Prince. But first, seeing
the immaculate condition of the porch floor, she
laid a sack down before the hungry dog and put the
pan upon it.
</p>
<p>
“For, you see,” she told Aunty Rose, who stood
in the kitchen doorway watching her, “when he has
a bone, he just <em>will</em> get grease all around. He really
can’t help it.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose made no audible comment, but she
seemed to view Prince with more curiosity than
hostility.
</p>
<p>
When the door closed again, Mrs. Kennedy went
to the stove, and instantly, with the opening of the
oven, the rush of delicious odour from it made
Carolyn May’s mouth fairly water. The lunch she
had eaten on the train seemed to have happened a
long, long time ago.
</p>
<p>
Such flaky biscuit—two great pans full of the
brown beauties! Mr. Stagg sat down at the table
and actually smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“You never made any bread that <em>smelt</em> better,
Aunty Rose,” he said emphatically.
</p>
<p>
She had removed her sunbonnet, and her grey-brown
hair proved to be in perfectly smooth braids
wound about her head. She must have been well
over sixty years of age. Uncle Joe seemed boyish
beside her; yet Carolyn May had at first thought the
hardware dealer a very old man.
</p>
<p>
The little girl took her indicated place at the table
timidly. The cloth was a red and white checked one,
freshly ironed, as were the napkins to match. There
was a squat old silver bowl in the middle of the
board, full of spoons of various sizes, and also a
castor, like a miniature carousel, holding several
bottles of sauces and condiments. The china was
of good quality and prettily flowered. The butter
was iced, and there was a great glass pitcher of milk,
which looked cool and inviting.
</p>
<p>
“Joseph Stagg,” said Aunty Rose, sitting down,
“ask a blessing.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe’s harsh voice seemed suddenly to become
gentle as he reverently said grace. A tear or
two squeezed through Carolyn May’s closed eyelids,
for that had been her duty at home; she had said
grace ever since she could speak plainly.
</p>
<p>
If Aunty Rose noticed the child’s emotion, she
made no comment, only helped her gravely to cold
meat, stewed potatoes, and hot biscuit.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg was in haste to eat and get back to the
store. “Or that Chet Gormley will try to make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
meal off some of the hardware, I guess,” he said
gloomily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, Uncle Joe” exclaimed Carolyn
May. “If he did that, he’d die of indignation.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? Oh! I guess ’twould cause indigestion,”
agreed her uncle.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose did not even smile. She sat so very
stiff and upright in her chair that her back never
touched the back of the chair; she was very precise
and exact in all her movements.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” Mr. Stagg exclaimed suddenly.
“What’s that on the mantel, Aunty Rose? That
yaller letter?”
</p>
<p>
“A telegram for you, Joseph Stagg,” replied
the old lady as composedly as though the receipt
of a telegram was an hourly occurrence at The
Corners.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” muttered the hardware dealer, and
Carolyn May wondered if he were not afraid to
express just the emotion he felt at that instant. His
face was red, and he got up clumsily to secure the
sealed message.
</p>
<p>
“Who brought it, and when?” he asked finally,
having read the lawyer’s night letter.
</p>
<p>
“A boy. This morning,” said Aunty Rose, utterly
calm.
</p>
<p>
“And I never saw it this noon,” grumbled the
hardware dealer.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kennedy quite ignored any suggestion of
impatience in Mr. Stagg’s voice or manner. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
seemed to lose taste for his supper after reading
the telegram.
</p>
<p>
“Where is the letter that this Mr. Price wrote
and sent by you, Car’lyn?” he asked as he was about
to depart for the store.
</p>
<p>
The little girl asked permission to leave the table,
and then ran to open her bag. Mr. Stagg said
doubtfully:
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose you’ll have to put her somewhere—for
the present. Don’t see what else we can do, Aunty
Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“You may be sure, Joseph Stagg, that her room
was ready for her a week ago,” Mrs. Kennedy rejoined,
quite unruffled.
</p>
<p>
The surprised hardware dealer gurgled something
in his throat. “What room?” he finally stammered.
</p>
<p>
“That which was her mother’s. Hannah Stagg’s
room. It is next to mine, and she will come to no
harm there.”
</p>
<p>
“Hannah’s!” exclaimed Mr. Stagg. “Why,
that ain’t been slept in since she went away.”
</p>
<p>
“It is quite fit, then,” said Aunty Rose, “that it
should be used for her child. Trouble nothing about
things that do not concern you, Joseph Stagg,” she
added with, perhaps, additional sternness.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not hear this. She now produced
the letter from her lawyer neighbour.
</p>
<p>
“There it is, Uncle Joe,” she said. “I—I guess
he tells you all about me in it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” said the hardware man, clearing his
throat and picking up his hat. “I’ll read it down at
the store.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall—shall I see you again to-night, Uncle
Joe?” the little girl asked wistfully. “You know,
my bedtime’s half-past eight.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if you don’t see me to-night again, you’ll
be well cared for, I haven’t a doubt,” said Uncle
Joe shortly, and went out.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May went soberly back to her chair. She
did not eat much more. Somehow there seemed to
be a big lump in her throat past which she could not
force the food. As the dusk fell, the spirit of loneliness
gripped her, and the tears pooled behind her
eyelids, ready to pour over her cheeks at the least
“joggle.” Yet she was not usually a “cry-baby”
girl.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose was watching her more closely than
Carolyn May supposed. After her third cup of tea
she arose and began quietly clearing the table. The
newcomer was nodding in her place, her blue eyes
clouded with sleep and unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
“It is time for you to go to bed, Car’lyn May,”
said Aunty Rose firmly. “I will show you the room
Hannah Stagg had for her own when she was a girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Aunty Rose,” said the little girl
humbly.
</p>
<p>
She picked up the bag and followed the stately
old woman into the back hall and up the stairway
into the ell. Carolyn May saw that at the foot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
the stairs was a door leading out upon the porch
where Prince was now moving about uneasily at the
end of his leash. She would have liked to say
“good-night” to Prince, but it seemed better not to
mention this feeling to Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
The fading hues of sunset in the sky gave the
little girl plenty of light to undress by. She thought
the room very beautiful, too. It was large, and the
ceiling sloped at one side; the bed was wide and
plump looking. It had four funny, spindle-shaped
posts, and it was covered with a bright patchwork
quilt of many tiny squares—quite an intricate pattern,
Carolyn May thought.
</p>
<p>
“Do you need any help, child?” asked Mrs.
Kennedy, standing in her soldierly manner in the
doorway. It was dusky there, and the little girl
could not see her face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, ma’am,” said Carolyn May faintly. “I
can button and unbutton every button. I learned
long ago. And my nightie’s right in my bag here.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” said Aunty Rose, and turned away.
Carolyn May stood in the middle of the room and
listened to her descending footsteps. <em>Aunty Rose
had not even bidden her good-night!</em>
</p>
<p>
Like a marooned sailor upon a desert island, the
little girl went about exploring the bedroom which
was to be hers—and which had once been her
mother’s. That fact helped greatly. Her mother
had slept in this very bed—had looked into that
cunning, clouded glass over the dressing table—had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
sat in this very little rocking chair to take off her
shoes and stockings—had hung her dress, perhaps,
over this other chair.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May kept repeating these things as she
divested herself of her garments and got into the
nightgown that Mrs. Price had freshly ironed for
her. Then she looked at the high, “puffy” bed.
</p>
<p>
“How ever <em>can</em> I get into it?” sighed Carolyn
May.
</p>
<p>
She had to stand upon her tiptoes in her fluffy
little bedroom slippers to pull back the quilt, and the
blanket and sheet underneath it. The bed was just
a great big bag of feathers!
</p>
<p>
“Just like a big, big pillow,” thought the little
girl. “And if I do get into it, I’m li’ble to sink
down, and down, and <em>down</em>, till I’m buried, and
won’t ever be able to get up in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had never seen anything softer to
sleep on than a mattress of pressed felt. A feather
bed might be all right, but she felt more than a little
shy of venturing into it.
</p>
<p>
The window was open, and she went to it and
looked out. A breath of honeysuckle blew in. Then,
below, on the porch, she heard the uneasy movements
of Prince. And he whined.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, poor Princey! He doesn’t know what’s
become of me,” thought Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
Downstairs, in the great kitchen, Aunty Rose was
stepping back and forth, from table to sink, from
sink to dresser, from dresser to pantry. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
daylight faded, she lit the lamp which swung from the
ceiling and gave light to all the room.
</p>
<p>
It would have been impossible for the wisest person
to guess what were the thoughts in Aunty Rose’s
mind. She might have been thinking of that sunny-haired,
blue-eyed little girl upstairs, so lately bereft
of those whom she loved, a stranger to-night in a new
home, going to bed for the first time in her life alone;
aye, she <em>might</em> have been thinking of her. Or she
might merely have been deciding in her mind whether
to have batter cakes or waffles for breakfast.
</p>
<p>
A glad little yelp from the dog tied to the rail of
the porch sounded suddenly. Even Aunty Rose
could not mistake that cry of welcome, and she knew
very little about dogs—to their credit, at least. She
had heard no other suspicious sound, but now she
crossed the room with firm tread and opened the
porch door. Yes, a little white figure was down
there, hugging the whining mongrel; and if the latter
could have spoken English he could have made it
no whit plainer how glad he was to see his little
mistress.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May’s tearful face was raised from
Prince’s rough neck.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty Rose! Oh, Aunty Rose!” she
sobbed. “I just <em>had</em> to say good-night to somebody.
Edna’s mother came and heard our prayers and
tucked us into my bed after my papa and mamma
went away. So it didn’t seem so bad.
</p>
<p>
“But to-night—Why! to-night there isn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
anybody cares whether I go to bed or not! But Prince!
Prince, <em>he</em> knows just how—how <em>empty</em> I feel!”
</p>
<p>
The woman stood in the doorway with the light
behind her, so Carolyn May could not see her face;
her voice was perfectly calm when she said:
</p>
<p>
“You would better come in now and wash your
face and hands again before going to bed. That
dog has been lapping them with his tongue.”
</p>
<p>
Sobbing, the little girl obeyed. The dog curled
down on the porch as though satisfied, having seen
that his little mistress was all right. The latter
trotted over the cold linoleum to the sink and did
as Mrs. Kennedy directed. Then she would have
gone back up the stairs without a word had not
Aunty Rose spoken.
</p>
<p>
“Come here, Carolyn May,” she said quite as
sternly as before.
</p>
<p>
The little girl approached her. The old lady sat
in one of the straightest of the straight-backed chairs,
her hands in her comfortable lap. The wet blue
eyes were raised to her composed face timidly.
</p>
<p>
“If you wish to say your prayers here, before
going upstairs, you may, Carolyn May,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, may I?” gasped the little girl.
</p>
<p>
She dropped her hands into Aunty Rose’s lap.
Somehow they found those larger, comforting hands
and cuddled into them as the little girl sank to her
knees on the braided mat.
</p>
<p>
If the simple “Now I lay me” was familiar to
Aunty Rose’s ear from long ago, she gave no sign.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
When the earnest little voice added to the formal
supplication a desire for the blessing of “Uncle Joe
and Aunty Rose,” the latter’s countenance retained
its composure.
</p>
<p>
She asked a blessing upon all her friends, including
the Prices, and even Prince. But it was after
that she put the timid question to Aunty Rose that
proved to be almost too much for that good woman’s
studied calm.
</p>
<p>
“Aunty Rose, do you s’pose I might ask God to
bless my mamma and papa, even if they <em>are</em> lost at
sea? Somehow, I don’t think it would seem so lonesome
if I could keep <em>that</em> in my prayer.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—“WELL—SHE’LL BE A NUISANCE”</h2>
<p>
Mr. Joseph Stagg, going down to his
store, past the home and carpenter shop of
Jedidiah Parlow, at which he did not even
look, finally came to his destination in a very brown
study. So disturbed had he been by the arrival of
his little niece that he forgot to question and cross-question
young Chetwood Gormley regarding the
possible customers that had been in the store during
his absence.
</p>
<p>
“And I tell you what I think, mother,” Chet said,
with his mouth full, at supper that evening. “I
think her coming’s goin’ to bring about changes.
Yes, ma’am!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gormley was a faded little woman—a
widow—who went out sewing for better-to-do people
in Sunrise Cove. She naturally thought her boy
Chetwood a great deal smarter than other people
thought him. And—as was natural, too—Chet developed
something like keenness in the sunshine of
her approval.
</p>
<p>
“You know, mother,” he said, on this evening of
the arrival of Carolyn May, “I never <em>have</em> seen any
great chance to rise, workin’ for Mr. Joseph Stagg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
His ain’t a business that offers an aspirin’ feller much
advancement.”
</p>
<p>
“But he <em>pays</em> you, Chet,” his mother said
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. I know. Don’t be afraid I’ll leave him
till I see something better,” he reassured her. “But
I might be clerkin’ for him till the cows come home
and never see more’n six or eight dollars a week.
But now it’s apt to be different.”
</p>
<p>
“How different, Chet?” she asked, puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“You know Mr. Stagg’s as hard as nails—as hard
as the goods he sells,” declared the gawky boy.
“No brass hinge, or iron bolt, or copper rivet in
his stock is any harder than he ’pears to be. Mind
you, he don’t do nothin’ mean. That ain’t his way.
But he don’t seem to have a mite of interest in anything
but his shop. Now, it seems to me, this little
niece is bound to wake him up. He calls her ‘Hannah’s
Car’lyn.’”
</p>
<p>
“Hannah Stagg was his only sister,” said Mrs.
Gormley softly. “I remember her.”
</p>
<p>
“And she’s just died, or something, and left this
little girl,” Chet continued. “Mr. Stagg’s bound
to think of something now besides business. And
mebbe he’ll need <em>me</em> more. And I’ll get a chance to
show him I’m worth something to him. So, by-and-by,
he’ll put me forward in the business,” said the
boy, his homely face glowing. “Who knows?
Mebbe it’ll be Stagg &amp; Gormley over the door one
of these days. Stranger things have happened.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t that be fine, Chet!” agreed his
mother, taking fire at last from his enthusiasm.
“And you think this pretty little girl’s comin’ here
is goin’ to do all that?”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps even Chetwood’s assurance would have
been quenched had he just then known the thoughts
in the hardware merchant’s mind. Mr. Stagg sat
in his back office poring over the letter written by
his brother-in-law’s lawyer friend, a part of which
read:
</p>
<p>
“From the above recital of facts you will plainly
see, being a man of business yourself, that Mr.
Cameron’s financial affairs were in a much worse
condition when he went away than he himself
dreamed of.
</p>
<p>
“I immediately looked up the Stonebridge Building
and Loan Association. It is even more moribund
than the papers state. The fifteen hundred
dollars Mr. Cameron put into it from time to time
might just as well have been dropped into the
sea.
</p>
<p>
“You know, he had only his salary on <em>The Morning
Beacon</em>. They were rather decent to him, when
they saw his health breaking down, to offer him the
chance of going to the Mediterranean as correspondent.
He was to furnish articles on ‘The Débris of
a World War’—stories of the peaceful sections of
Europe which have to care for the human wrecks
from the battlefields.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“It rather cramped Mr. Cameron’s immediate
resources for your sister to go with him, and he
drew ahead on his expense and salary account. I
know that Mrs. Cameron feared to allow him to go
alone across the ocean. He was really in a bad way;
but she proposed to come back immediately on the
<em>Dunraven</em> if he improved on the voyage across.
</p>
<p>
“Their means really did not allow of their taking
the child; the steamship company would not hear
of a half-fare for her. She is a nice little girl, and
my wife would have been glad to keep her longer,
but in the end she would have to go to you, as, I
understand, there are no other relatives.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, the flat is here, and the furniture.
If you do not care to come on to attend to the matter
yourself, I will do the best I can to dispose of either
or both. Mr. Cameron had paid a year’s rent in
advance—rather an unwise thing, I thought—and
the term has still ten months to run. He did it so
that his wife, on her return from abroad, might have
no worry on her mind. Perhaps the flat might be
sublet, furnished, to advantage. You might state
your pleasure regarding this.
</p>
<p>
“You will see, by the copy of your brother-in-law’s
will that I enclose, that you have been left in
full and sole possession and guardianship of his
property and affairs, including Carolyn May.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
And if somebody had shipped him a crocodile
from the Nile, Joseph Stagg would have felt little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
more at a loss as to what disposal to make of the
creature than he felt now regarding his little
niece.
</p>
<p>
“Well—she’ll be a nuisance; an awful nuisance,”
was his final comment, with a mountainous sigh.
</p>
<p>
Thus far, Aunty Rose Kennedy’s attitude towards
the little stranger had been the single pleasant disappointment
Mr. Stagg had experienced. Aunty
Rose was an autocrat. Joseph Stagg had never been
so comfortable in his life as since Mrs. Kennedy
had taken up the management of his home. But he
stood in great awe of her.
</p>
<p>
He put the lawyer’s letter in the safe. For once
he was unable to respond to a written communication
promptly. Although he wore that band of crêpe on
his arm, he could not actually realise the fact that
his sister Hannah was dead.
</p>
<p>
Any time these fifteen years he might have run
down to New York to see her. First, she had
worked in the newspaper office as a stenographer.
Then she had married John Lewis Cameron, and
they had gone immediately to housekeeping.
</p>
<p>
Cameron was a busy man; he held a “desk job”
on the paper. Vacations had been hard to get.
And, before long, Hannah had written about her
baby—“Hannah’s Car’lyn.”
</p>
<p>
After the little one’s arrival there seemed less
chance than before for the city family to get up to
Sunrise Cove. But at any time he might have gone
to them. If Joseph Stagg had shut up his store for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
a week and gone to New York, it would not have
brought the world to an end.
</p>
<p>
Nor was it because he was stingy that he had not
done this. No, he was no miser. But he was fairly
buried in his business. And there was no “look up”
in that dim little office in the back of the hardware
store. His nose was in the big ledger all the time,
and there was no better or brighter outlook for him.
</p>
<p>
Business. No other interest, social or spiritual,
had Joseph Stagg. To his mind, time was wasted,
used in any but the three very necessary ways—eating,
sleeping, and attending to one’s business.
</p>
<p>
He kept his store open every evening. Not because
there was trade enough to warrant it—that
was only on Saturday nights—but what would he do
if he did not come down after supper and sit in his
office for a couple of hours? There he could always
find work to do. Outside, he was at a loss for something
with which to occupy his mind.
</p>
<p>
On this evening he closed the store later than
usual, and set out for The Corners slowly. To tell
the truth, Mr. Stagg rather shrank from arriving
home. The strangeness of having a child in the
house disturbed his tranquillity.
</p>
<p>
The kitchen only was lighted when he approached;
therefore, he was reassured. He knew Hannah’s
Car’lyn must have been put to bed long since.
</p>
<p>
It was dark under the trees, and only long familiarity
with the walk enabled him to reach the back
porch noiselessly. Then it was that something scrambled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
up in the dark, and the roar of a dog’s barking
made Joseph Stagg leap back in fright.
</p>
<p>
“Drat that mongrel!” he ejaculated, remembering
Prince.
</p>
<p>
The kitchen door opened, revealing Aunty Rose’s
ample figure. Prince whined sheepishly and dropped
his abbreviated tail, going to lie down again at the
extreme end of his leash, and blinking his eyes at
Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
“The critter’s as savage as a bear!” grumbled
the hardware merchant.
</p>
<p>
“He is a good watchdog; you must allow that,
Joseph Stagg,” Aunty Rose said calmly.
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer gasped again. It would be
hard to say which had startled him the most—the
dog or Aunty Rose’s manner.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—AUNTY ROSE UNBENDS</h2>
<p>
There never was a lovelier place for a little
girl—to say nothing of a dog—to play in
than the yard about the Stagg homestead;
and this Carolyn May confided to Aunty Rose one
forenoon after her arrival at The Corners.
</p>
<p>
Behind the house the yard sloped down to a broad,
calmly flowing brook. Here the goose and duck
pens were fenced off, for Aunty Rose would not
allow the web-footed fowl to wander at large, as
did the other poultry.
</p>
<p>
It was difficult for Prince to learn that none of
these feathered folk were to be molested. He loved
to jump into the water after a stick, and whenever
he did so, the quacking and hissing inside the wire-fenced
runs showed just how unpopular his dogship
was in that community.
</p>
<p>
There was a wide-branching oak tree on a knoll
overlooking the brook. Around its trunk Uncle Joe
had built a seat. Carolyn May found this a grand
place to sit and dream, while Prince lay at her feet
with his pink tongue out, occasionally snapping at
a gnat.
</p>
<p>
When they saw Aunty Rose, in her sunbonnet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
going towards the fenced-in garden, they both
jumped up and bounded down the slope after her.
It was just here, at the corner of the garden fence,
that Carolyn May had her first adventure.
</p>
<p>
Prince, of course, disturbed the serenity of the
poultry. The hens went shrieking one way, the
guinea fowl lifted up their voices in angry chatter,
the turkey hens scurried to cover, but the old turkey
cock, General Bolivar, a big, white Holland fowl,
was not to have his dignity disturbed and his courage
impugned by any four-footed creature with waggish
ears and the stump of a tail.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, General Bolivar charged with outspread
wings and quivering fan. His eyesight was
not good, however. He charged the little girl instead
of the roistering dog.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May frankly screamed. Thirty-five
pounds, or more, of solid meat, frame, and feathers
catapulted through the air at one is not to be ignored.
Had the angry turkey reached the little girl, he
would have beaten her down, and perhaps seriously
injured her.
</p>
<p>
He missed her the first time, but turned to charge
again. Prince barked loudly, circling around the
bristling turkey cock, undecided just how to get into
the battle. But Aunty Rose knew no fear of anything
wearing feathers.
</p>
<p>
“Scat, you brute!” she cried, and made a grab
for the turkey, gripping him with her left hand
behind his head, bearing his long neck downward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
In her other hand she seized a piece of lath, and with
it chastised the big turkey across the haunches with
vigour.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t spank him any more, Aunty Rose!”
gasped Carolyn May at last. “He <em>must</em> be sorry.”
</p>
<p>
With a final stroke Aunty Rose allowed the big
fowl to go—and he ran away fast enough. But the
austere Mrs. Kennedy did not consider the matter
ended there. She had punished one culprit; now she
turned to Prince.
</p>
<p>
“Your dog, child, does not know his manners.
If he is going to stay here with you, he must learn
that fowl are not to be chased nor startled.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty Rose!” begged the little girl, “<em>don’t</em>
punish Prince! Not—not that way. Please, don’t!
Why, he’s never been spanked in his life! He
wouldn’t know what it meant. <em>Dear</em> Aunty
Rose——”
</p>
<p>
“I shall not beat him, Car’lyn May,” interrupted
Aunty Rose. “But he must learn his lesson. He
has never run at liberty in his life before, as he does
here, I warrant.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, ma’am; he never has. Only in the park
early in the morning. Papa used to take him out
for a run before he went to bed. The policemen
didn’t mind if Prince <em>was</em> off his leash then.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Before he went to bed?’” repeated Aunty
Rose curiously. “What time did your papa go to
bed, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he worked on a morning paper, you see,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
and he didn’t get home till ’most sunrise—in summer,
I mean. He slept in the forenoon.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, such a way to live!” murmured Aunty
Rose, scandalised. Then she returned to the subject
of Prince’s punishment. “Your dog must learn that
liberty is not license. Bring him here, Car’lyn May.”
</p>
<p>
She led the way to an open coop of laths in the
middle of the back yard. This was a hutch in which
she put broody hens when she wished to break up
their desire to set. She opened the gate of it and
motioned Prince to enter.
</p>
<p>
The dog looked pleadingly at his little mistress’
face, then into the woman’s stern countenance. Seeing
no reprieve in either, with drooping tail he slunk
into the cage.
</p>
<p>
With one hand clutching her frock over her heart,
Carolyn May’s big blue eyes overflowed.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just as if he was arrested,” she said. “Poor
Prince! Has he got to stay there <em>always</em>, Aunty
Rose?”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll stay till he learns his lesson,” said Mrs.
Kennedy grimly, and went on into the garden.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May sat down close to the side of the
cage, thrust one hand between the slats, and held
one of the dog’s front paws. She had hoped to go
into the garden to help Aunty Rose pick peas, but
she could not bear to leave Prince alone.
</p>
<p>
By-and-by Mrs. Kennedy came up from the garden,
her pan heaped with pods. She looked neither
in the direction of the prisoner nor at his little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
mistress. Carolyn May wanted awfully to shell the
peas. She liked to shell peas, and Aunty Rose had
more in her pan than the little girl had ever shelled
at one time at home.
</p>
<p>
Prince whined and lay down. He had begun to
realise now that this was no play, at all, but punishment.
He blinked his eyes at Carolyn May and
looked as sorry as ever a dog with cropped ears and
an abbreviated tail could look.
</p>
<p>
The hutch was under a wide-branching tree. It
was shady, and the bees hummed. A motherly hen
with thirteen black chickens paraded by.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” thought Carolyn May dozily, “how
the mother can be so white and her family can be so
black. I believe there must be a mistake somewhere.
Suppose they shouldn’t turn out to be chickens at
all, but crows! Maybe she was fooled about the
eggs. You often <em>are</em> fooled about eggs, you know.
You can’t tell by the outside of an eggshell whether
what’s inside is fresh or not.
</p>
<p>
“And if those are little crows, and not chicks,
they’ll fly right up into the air some day and leave
her, and go sailing off across the brook, saying,
‘Caw! Caw! Caw!’”
</p>
<p>
“Why, there they go now!” gasped Carolyn
May—only, she <em>thought</em> she gasped, just as she
<em>thought</em> she saw the baker’s dozen of chicks flying
across the brook—for she was fast asleep and
dreaming.
</p>
<p>
Prince slept, too, and fought imaginary battles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
with the turkey cock in his dreams, jerking all four
of his legs, and growling dreadfully. Carolyn May
went wandering through fairyland, perhaps following
the chicken-crows she had first imagined.
</p>
<p>
The peas and potatoes were cooking for dinner
when Aunty Rose appeared again. There was the
little girl, all of a dewy sleep, lying on the grass by
the prison-pen. Aunty Rose would have released
Prince, but, though he wagged his stump of a tail
at her and yawned and blinked, she had still her
doubts regarding a mongrel’s good nature.
</p>
<p>
She could not allow the child to sleep there, however;
so, stooping, picked up Carolyn May and
carried her comfortably into the house, laying her
down on the sitting-room couch to have her nap
out—as she supposed, without awakening her.
</p>
<p>
It had been many a long day since Aunty Rose
Kennedy had stood over a sleeping child and watched
the silky eyelashes flutter and the breath part the
rosy lips ever so little. Carolyn May’s limbs were
dimpled; her golden hair was wavy, though it did
not curl; she was sweet and lovable in every way.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose came away softly and closed the door,
and while she finished getting dinner she tried to
make no noise which would awaken the child.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg came home at noon, quite as full of
business as usual. To tell the truth, Mr. Stagg
always felt bashful in Aunty Rose’s presence; and
he tried to hide his affliction by conversation. So he
talked steadily through the meal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
But somewhere—about at the pie course, it was—he
stopped and looked around curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” he exclaimed, “where’s Hannah’s
Car’lyn?”
</p>
<p>
“Taking a nap,” said Aunty Rose composedly.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! can’t the child get up to her victuals?”
demanded Mr. Stagg. “You begin serving that
young one separately and you’ll make yourself work,
Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“Never trouble about that which doesn’t concern
you, Joseph Stagg,” responded his housekeeper
rather tartly. “The Lord has placed the care of
Hannah’s Car’lyn on you and me, and I shall do my
share, and do it proper.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg shook his head and lost interest in his
wedge of berry pie. “There are institutions—” he
began weakly; but Aunty Rose said quickly:
</p>
<p>
“Joseph Stagg! I know you for what you are—other
people don’t. If the neighbours heard you
say <em>that</em>, they’d think you were a heathen. Your own
sister’s child!
</p>
<p>
“Now, you send Tim, the hackman, up after me
this afternoon. I’ve got to go shopping. The child
hasn’t a thing to wear but that fancy little black
frock, and she’ll ruin that playing around. She’s got
to have frocks, and shoes, and another hat—all sorts
of things. Seems a shame to dress a child like her
in black—it’s punishment. Makes her affliction
double, I do say.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose we’ve got to flatter Custom, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Custom will weep,” growled Mr. Stagg. “But
where the money’s coming from——”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t Car’lyn’s pa leave her none?” asked
Aunty Rose promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Well—not what you’d call a fortune,” admitted
Mr. Stagg slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks be, you’ve got plenty, then. And if you
haven’t, I have,” said the woman in a tone that quite
closed the question of finances.
</p>
<p>
“Which shows me just where I get off at,” muttered
Joseph Stagg as he started down the walk for
the store. “I knew that young one would be a
nuisance.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—MR. JEDIDIAH PARLOW</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May, who was quite used to taking
a nap on the days that she did not go to
school, woke up, as bright as a newly minted
dollar, very soon after her Uncle Joe left for the
store.
</p>
<p>
“I’m awfully sorry I missed him,” she confided
to Aunty Rose when she danced into the kitchen.
“You see, I want to get acquainted with Uncle Joe
just as fast as possible. And he’s at home so little,
I guess that it’s going to be hard to do it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, is that so? And is it going to be hard to
get acquainted with me?” asked the housekeeper
curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!” cried Carolyn May, snuggling up to
the good woman and patting her plump, bare arm.
“Why, I’m getting ’quainted with <em>you</em> fast, Aunty
Rose! You heard me say my prayers, and when
you laid me down on the couch just now you kissed
me.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose actually blushed. “There, there,
child!” she exclaimed. “You’re too noticing. Eat
your dinner, that I’ve saved warm for you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t Prince to have any dinner, Aunty Rose?”
asked the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“You may let him out, if you wish, after you have
had your own dinner. You can feed him under the
tree. But stand by and keep the hens away, for hens
haven’t any more morals than they have teeth, and
they’ll steal from him. I don’t want him to snap any
of their heads off before they’re ready for the pot.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty Rose,” said Carolyn May seriously,
“he’s too polite. He wouldn’t do such a thing.
Really, you don’t know yet what a <em>good</em> dog
Prince is.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was very much excited about an
hour later when a rusty, closed hack drew up to the
front gate of the Stagg place and stopped. She and
Prince were then playing in the front yard—at least,
she was stringing maple keys into a long, long chain
(a delight heretofore unknown to the little city girl),
and the dog was watching her with wrinkling nose
and blinking eyes.
</p>
<p>
An old man with a square-cut chin whisker and
clothing and hat as rusty as the hack itself held the
reins over the bony back of the horse that drew the
ancient equipage.
</p>
<p>
“I say, young’un, ain’t ye out o’ yer bailiwick?”
queried Tim, the hackman, staring at the little girl
in the Stagg yard.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May stood up quickly and tried to look
over her shoulder and down her back. It <em>was</em> hard
to get all those buttons buttoned straight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she said, perturbed. “Does it
show?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” grunted Tim. “Does what show?”
</p>
<p>
“What you said,” said Carolyn May accusingly.
“I don’t believe it does.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey!” chuckled the hack driver suddenly. “I
meant, do you ’low Mrs. Kennedy knows you’re playing
in her front yard?”
</p>
<p>
“Aunty Rose? Why, of course!” Carolyn May
declared. “Don’t you know I <em>live</em> here?”
</p>
<p>
“Live here? Get out!” exclaimed the surprised
hackman.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. And Prince, too. With my Uncle
Joe and Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” ejaculated
Tim. “You don’t mean Joe Stagg’s taken a young-’un
to board?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s my guardian,” said the little girl primly.
</p>
<p>
“‘Guardian’?” repeated the hackman, puzzled.
“You don’t mean you’re one o’ them fresh-airs,
be ye?”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was quite as much puzzled by that
expression as she had been by “bailiwick.” She
shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I am,” she confessed. “Mrs.
Price said I was an orphan. Is that anything like a
fresh-air?”
</p>
<p>
“Most of them is,” the hackman said sententiously.
“But here’s Mrs. Kennedy.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose appeared. She wore a close bonnet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
trimmed very plainly, and carried a parasol of drab
silk. Otherwise, she had not changed her usual
attire, save to remove the voluminous apron she
wore when at her housework.
</p>
<p>
“I would take you with me, child,” she said,
looking at Carolyn May, “only I don’t know what
to do with that dog. I suppose he would tear the
house down if we shut him in?”
</p>
<p>
“I expect so,” admitted the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“And if he was outside, he would follow the
hack?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” agreed Carolyn May again.
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ll have to stay at home and watch
him,” said Aunty Rose decisively. “I always claimed
a dog was a nuisance.”
</p>
<p>
Between Uncle Joe and Aunty Rose, both of the
visitors at the Stagg place were proving to be
nuisances.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose climbed into the creaky old vehicle.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to be gone long?” asked Carolyn
May politely.
</p>
<p>
“Not more than two hours, child,” said the
housekeeper. “Nobody will bother you here——”
</p>
<p>
“Not while that dog’s with her, I reckon,” put
in Tim, the hackman.
</p>
<p>
“May I come down the road to meet you, Aunty
Rose?” asked the little girl. “I know the way to
Uncle Joe’s store.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know any reason why you can’t come to
meet me,” replied Mrs. Kennedy. “Anyway, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
can come along the road as far as the first house.
You know that one?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. Mr. Parlow’s,” said Carolyn
May.
</p>
<p>
“She knows her way ’round, I warrant,” put in
Tim.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, child,” said Aunty Rose, and the bony
old horse started slowly down the dusty road. Carolyn
May stood at the gate and watched it wabble
away. The hush of the afternoon wrapped the place
about. Such a stir as there had been about The
Corners in the forenoon seemed to have been quite
quenched. Not even the clank of iron on iron from
the blacksmith shop was now audible.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May went back into the yard and sat on
the front-porch steps, and Prince, yawning unhappily,
curled down at her feet. There did not seem
to be much to do at this place. The little girl lost
interest in the maple-key chain which Aunty Rose
had shown her how to make.
</p>
<p>
She had time now, had Carolyn May, to compare
The Corners with the busy Harlem streets with
which she had been familiar all her life. At this
time of the afternoon the shady sides of the cross
streets and the west side of the avenues were a-bustle
with baby carriages and children, with nurses and
mothers. And there were street pianos, and penny
peep shows, and ice-cream-cone peddlers, and
wagons, and many automobiles.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” thought Carolyn May, startled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
by her own imagination, “suppose all the folks in
all these houses around here were <em>dead</em>!”
</p>
<p>
They might have been, for all the human noises
she heard. She could count seven dwellings from
where she sat on the Stagg porch, and there were
others not in sight. No apparent life at the blacksmith
shop; none at the store. Not even a vehicle
on the road, now that the hack had crawled out of
view towards Sunrise Cove.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” she said again, and this time
she jumped up, startling Prince from his nap.
“Maybe there is a spell cast over all this place,”
she went on. “Everybody has been put to sleep,
just like in a fairy story. I don’t know whether a
little girl who <em>isn’t</em> asleep can wake ’em up, or
whether it must be a prince.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Princey,” she added, looking at the dog,
“maybe it will be <em>you</em> that wakes ’em up. Anyway,
let’s go and see if we can find <em>somebody</em> that’s
alive.”
</p>
<p>
They went out of the yard together and took the
dusty road towards the town. They passed the
broad front of the church, its windows like so many
blind eyes, and the little girl peered timidly over the
rusty railing into the neglected churchyard, where
many of the headstones were moss-grown and
toppling.
</p>
<p>
“This is just the very <em>deadest</em> place,” murmured
Carolyn May. “And I guess these folks buried
here aren’t much quieter than the live folks. Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
dear me! these folks here at The Corners don’t look
up to brighter things any more than the folks that
are under ground. Why, maybe <em>I’ll</em> get that way if
I stay here! And I know Papa Cameron wouldn’t
approve of <em>that</em>!”
</p>
<p>
She sighed, and trudged on in the dust. The perspiration
began to trickle down her pink face. The
powdery dust rose from beneath her feet and was
drifted over the wayside grass and weeds by the
fretful breeze.
</p>
<p>
Prince paced on by her side, his nose wrinkling at
the strange odours the breeze brought to his nostrils.
A toad hopped suddenly out of its ambuscade
beside the path, and Prince jumped.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t touch the toad, Princey,” said the little
girl. “You know we learned about toads at school—and
how good they are. And there was one in
Central Park—don’t you ’member?”
</p>
<p>
A minute later, however, as they went on, something
flashed into view on the top rail of the boundary
fence. It brought a yelp of delight from Prince
and a startled cry to Carolyn May’s lips.
</p>
<p>
“A squirrel!”
</p>
<p>
Prince leaped for the fence. With a whisk of
its tail, the squirrel went up the hole of the nearest
tree, and out on one of the branches, right over their
heads.
</p>
<p>
Prince danced about madly in the dust and yelped.
</p>
<p>
“You silly thing, you,” the little girl told him.
“You <em>know</em> you can’t climb that tree.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
The squirrel chattered angrily overhead.
</p>
<p>
“Now, come away,” Carolyn May commanded.
“Don’t you see you’ve made that squirrel mad at
you? You’ll <em>never</em> make friends out here in the
country, if you act this way, Princey.”
</p>
<p>
Prince seemed little impressed by this prophecy,
but he followed after his little mistress and left the
squirrel to its own devices. They soon came in sight
of the Parlow house and carpenter shop.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t go beyond that,” said Carolyn May.
“Aunty Rose told us not to. And Uncle Joe says
the carpenter-man isn’t a pleasant man.”
</p>
<p>
She looked wistfully at the premises. The cottage
seemed quite as much under the “spell” as had
been those dwellings at The Corners. But from the
shop came the sound of a plane shrieking over a long
board.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Princey!” gasped Carolyn May. “I
b’lieve he’s making long, curly shavings!”
</p>
<p>
If there was one thing Carolyn May adored, it
was curls. Because her own sunny hair was almost
perfectly straight, she thought the very loveliest
thing a fairy godmother could do for her was to fit
her out with a perfect suit of curls.
</p>
<p>
There had been a carpenter shop only two blocks
from where she lived in Harlem, and she and her
friend, Edna Price, had sometimes gone there and
begged a few curly shavings with which to bedeck
themselves. But they could never get as many shavings
as they wanted there, for the man swept them up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
every day and put them in bags, to be sold for
baling.
</p>
<p>
But here, at this carpenter’s shop, she had seen,
only the afternoon before, great heaps of the most
beautiful, curly, smelly shavings! She drew nearer,
her hand upon Prince’s collar, and stood looking at
the old man with the silver-bowed spectacles pushing
away at the jack-plane.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, Mr. Jedidiah Parlow looked up and
saw the wistful, dust-streaked face under the black
hat-brim and above the black frock. He stared at
her for fully a minute, poising the plane over his
work. Then he put it down and came to the door
of the shop.
</p>
<p>
“You’re Hannah Stagg’s little girl, aren’t you?”
he asked in a voice Carolyn May thought almost as
dry as his shavings.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” she said, and sighed. Dear me, he
knew who she was right away! There would not be
any chance of her getting a suit of long curls.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve come here to live, have you?” said Mr.
Parlow slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. You see, my papa and mamma were
lost at sea—with the <em>Dunraven</em>. It was a mistake, I
guess,” sighed the little girl, “for they weren’t fighting
anybody. But the <em>Dunraven</em> got in the way of
some ships that were fighting, in a place called the
Mediterranean Ocean, and the <em>Dunraven</em> was sunk,
and only a few folks were saved from it. My papa
and mamma weren’t saved.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“So?” said the carpenter, pushing his big spectacles
up to his forehead. “I read about it. Too
bad—too mighty bad! I remember Hannah Stagg,”
he added, winking his eyes, Carolyn May thought, a
good deal as Prince did. “You look like her.”
</p>
<p>
“Do I?” Carolyn May returned, drawing nearer.
“I’m glad I do. And I’m glad I sleep in what used
to be her bed, too. It doesn’t seem so lonesome.”
</p>
<p>
“So? I reckoned you’d be lonesome up there at
The Corners,” said the carpenter. “Is that your
dog?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s Prince—yes, sir,” Carolyn May said, looking
at the panting mongrel proudly. “He’s a <em>splendid</em>
dog. I know he must be valuable, even if he is a
mongorel. He got his paw hurt once, and papa
and I took him to a vetrernary.
</p>
<p>
“A vetrernary,” explained Carolyn May, “is a
dog doctor. And I heard this one tell my papa that
there must be blood of ’most all kinds of dogs there
was in Prince’s veins. There aren’t many dogs like
him.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I reckon not. Not many have such a pedigree,”
admitted the carpenter, taking up his plane.
Then he squinted curiously across it at Carolyn May.
“I guess your papa was some different from Joe
Stagg, wasn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes; he didn’t look much like Uncle Joe.
You see, they aren’t really related,” explained Carolyn
May innocently.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow grunted and stripped another shaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
from the edge of the board he was planing. Carolyn
May’s eager eyes followed that curling ribbon, and
her lips parted. There were just <em>bushels</em> of shavings
lying all about the shop—and Uncle Joe said Mr.
Parlow would not give away a single one!
</p>
<p>
The carpenter paused before pushing the plane a
second time the length of the board. “Don’t you
want a drink of water, little girl?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir—I would. And I know Prince
would like a drink,” she told him quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Go right around to the well in the back yard,”
said Mr. Parlow. “You’ll find a glass there—and
Mandy keeps a pan on the well-curb for the dogs
and cats.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you; I’ll go,” the little girl said, and
started around by the green lane to the yard behind
the cottage and the carpenter shop.
</p>
<p>
She hoped she would see Miss Amanda Parlow;
but she saw nobody. The well was like the one in
the Stagg back yard—it had a sweep and a smooth
pole and chain that lowered the bucket into the depth
of the shaft.
</p>
<p>
But it seemed as though somebody must have
known the little girl was coming, for a dripping
bucket of water had just been lifted upon the shelf,
and the pan on the well-curb was filled. Prince
lapped up the water from this eagerly.
</p>
<p>
All the time Carolyn May was getting her drink
she felt she was being watched. She gazed frankly
all about, but saw nobody. The green blinds were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
tightly closed over the cottage windows; yet the
child wondered if somebody inside was not looking
out at her. Was it the nice-looking lady she had
seen the day before—Miss Amanda, who would not
look at Uncle Joe?
</p>
<p>
She went back to the door of the carpenter shop
and found Mr. Parlow still busily at work.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me,” he said, in his dry voice, after a
little while, “you aren’t much like other little girls.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t I?” responded Carolyn May wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“No. Most little girls that come here want shavings
to play with,” said the carpenter, quizzically
eyeing her over his work.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Carolyn May, almost jumping.
“And do you give ’em to ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“’Most always,” admitted Mr. Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Can <em>I</em> have some?” she gasped.
</p>
<p>
“All you want,” said Mr. Parlow, and perhaps
that funny noise he made in his throat was as near
to a laugh as he ever got.
</p>
<p>
When Tim’s old hack crawled along the road
from town, with Aunty Rose sitting inside, enthroned
amidst a multitude of bundles, Carolyn May was
bedecked with a veritable wig of long, crisp curls,
each carefully thrust under the brim of her hat.
And when she shook the curls, Prince barked at her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, child, you certainly have made a mess of
yourself,” said the housekeeper. “Has she been
annoying you, Jedidiah Parlow?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
“She’s the only Stagg that ain’t annoyed me since
her mother went away,” said the carpenter gruffly.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose looked at him levelly. “I wonder,”
she said. “But, you see, she isn’t wholly a Stagg.”
</p>
<p>
This, of course, did not explain matters to Carolyn
May in the least. Nor did what Aunty Rose
said to her on the way home in the hot, stuffy hack
help the little girl to understand the trouble between
her uncle and Mr. Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“Better not let Joseph Stagg see you so friendly
with Jedidiah Parlow. Let sleeping dogs lie,” Mrs.
Kennedy observed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—A TRAGIC SITUATION</h2>
<p>
Such was the introduction of Carolyn May to
The Corners. It was not a very exciting life
she had entered into, but the following two or
three weeks were very full.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose insisted upon her being properly fitted
out with clothing for the summer and fall. Mrs.
Price sent on by express certain of the child’s possessions
that would be useful, but Aunty Rose declared
the local seamstress must make a number of
dresses for Carolyn May. The latter had to go to
the dressmaker’s house to be fitted, and that is
how she became acquainted with Chet Gormley’s
mother.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gormley was helping the dressmaker, and
they both made much of Carolyn May. Aunty Rose
allowed her to go for her fittings alone—of course,
with Prince as a companion—so, without doubt,
Mrs. Gormley, who loved a “dish of gossip,” talked
more freely with the little girl than she would have
done in Mrs. Kennedy’s presence.
</p>
<p>
One afternoon the little girl appeared at the
dressmaker’s (it was only two houses nearer the
centre of Sunrise Cove than the Parlow cottage)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
with Prince’s collar decorated with short, curly shavings.
This Elizabethan ruff may or may not have
caused the dog to look “extinguished,” as Carolyn
May pointed out, but it certainly made him uncomfortable.
However, he endured this dressing-up to
please his little mistress.
</p>
<p>
“I take it you’ve stopped at Jed Parlow’s shop,
child,” said Mrs. Gormley with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am,” returned Carolyn May. “Do you
know, he’s very lib’ral.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Lib’ral’?” repeated Mrs. Gormley. “I never
heard of old Jed Parlow bein’ accused of that before.
Did you, Mrs. Maine?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Maine was the dressmaker; and she bit off
her words when she spoke, much as she bit off her
threads.
</p>
<p>
“No. I never—heard Jed Parlow—called that—no!”
declared Mrs. Maine emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” little Carolyn May said quite
eagerly, “he gives me all the shavings I want. I—I
guess folks don’t just understand about Mr. Parlow,”
she added, remembering what her uncle had first
said about the carpenter. “He <em>is</em> real lib’ral.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a wonder to me,” drawled Mrs. Gormley,
“that he has a thing to do with <em>a certain party</em>, Mrs.
Maine, considerin’ how his daughter feels towards
that <em>certain party’s</em> relation. What d’you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess—there’s sumpin—to be said—on both
sides—o’ that controversy,” responded the dressmaker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“Meanin’ that mebbe <em>a certain party’s</em> relative
feels just as cross as Mandy Parlow?” suggested
Mrs. Gormley.
</p>
<p>
“Yep,” agreed the other woman, biting off her
answer and her thread at the same instant.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May listened, much puzzled. She wondered
just who “a certain party” could be. It
sounded very mysterious.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Maine was called away upon some household
task, and Mrs. Gormley seemed to change the
subject of conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t your uncle, Mr. Stagg, ever speak to you
about Mandy Parlow?” she asked the little girl.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had to think about this before
answering. Then she remembered.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” she said brightly.
</p>
<p>
“He does? Do tell!” exclaimed Mrs. Gormley
eagerly. “What does he say?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he says her name is <em>Miss</em> Amanda
Parlow.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gormley flushed rather oddly and glanced
at the child with suspicion. But little Carolyn May
was perfectly frank and ingenuous.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” ejaculated Chet’s mother. “He
never says nothing about bein’ in love with Mandy,
does he? They was goin’ with each other steady
once.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“When folks love each other they look at each
other and talk to each other, don’t they?” she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well—yes—generally,” admitted Mrs. Gormley.
</p>
<p>
“Then my Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda Parlow
aren’t in love,” announced Carolyn May with confidence,
“for they don’t even look at each other.”
</p>
<p>
“They used to. Why, Joseph Stagg and Mandy
Parlow was sweethearts years and years ago! Long
before your mother left these parts, child.”
</p>
<p>
“That was a long time ’fore I was borned,” said
the little girl wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. Everybody that went to The Corners’
church thought they’d be married.”
</p>
<p>
“My Uncle Joe and Miss Mandy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, what would have become of Aunty
Rose?” queried Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mrs. Kennedy hadn’t gone to keep house
for Mr. Stagg then,” replied Mrs. Gormley. “He
tried sev’ral triflin’ critters there at the Stagg place
before she took hold.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May looked at Mrs. Gormley encouragingly.
She was very much interested in Uncle Joe
and Miss Amanda Parlow’s love affair.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Why</em> didn’t they get married—like my papa
and mamma?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness knows!” exclaimed Mrs. Gormley.
“Some says ’twas his fault and some says ’twas
hern. And mebbe ’twas a third party’s that I might
mention, at <em>that</em>,” added Mrs. Gormley, pursing up
her lips in a very knowing way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
Here was another mysterious “party”! Carolyn
May wondered if this “party” could be related to
the “certain party” who seemed so familiar to both
of the “dressmaking ladies.”
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t get nothin’ out of either Mr. Stagg
or Mandy about it, I don’t believe. They’re both as
tight-mouthed as clams,” pursued Mrs. Gormley.
“But one day,” she said, growing confidential, “it
was in camp-meeting time—one day somebody seen
Joe Stagg drivin’ out with another girl—Charlotte
Lenny, that was. <em>She</em> was married to a man over in
Springdale long ago. Mr. Stagg took Charlotte to
Faith Camp Meeting.
</p>
<p>
“Then, the very next week, Mandy went with
Evan Peckham to a barn dance at Crockett’s, and
nobody ain’t ever seen your uncle and Mandy Parlow
speak since, much less ever walk together.
</p>
<p>
“Now stand up, child, and let’s see if this frock
fits. I declare, your uncle is a-fittin’ you out right
nice.”
</p>
<p>
If the truth were told, Uncle Joe did not agree to
the making of all these “frocks and furbelows” for
Hannah’s Car’lyn without the filing of some objections.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you, Aunty Rose,” he said to his austere
housekeeper (and it took courage for him to say
this), “I tell you the child will get it into her head
that she can <em>always</em> have all these things. Her father
didn’t leave anything—scarcely any money at all. I
don’t suppose, if I sell out that flat, I’d get a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
dollars for it. How are all these frocks and furbelows
going to be paid for?”
</p>
<p>
“You can stop in at the First National, Joseph
Stagg, and draw enough out of my account to pay
for them,” said Aunty Rose placidly.
</p>
<p>
“Huh? I guess not!” ejaculated the hardware
dealer angrily. “I can pay my just debts yet, I
hope—and them of Hannah’s Car’lyn, too. If
there’s money got to be spent on the child, I’m the
one to spend it.”
</p>
<p>
“Then don’t talk as though you were afraid the
sheriff was going to tack a notice on your store door
to-morrow morning,” returned the old lady tartly.
To herself she observed, out of his hearing: “It will
do Joseph Stagg good to learn to spend money, as
well as to make it.”
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Stagg did not take kindly to this, nor to
other innovations that the coming of Carolyn May
to The Corners brought about. Especially was he
outspoken about Prince. That faithful follower of
“Hannah’s Car’lyn” he failed to discover any use
for or any good in.
</p>
<p>
Prince was a friendly creature, and he did not
always display good judgment in showing his affection.
In his doggish mind he could not see why Mr.
Stagg did not like him; he approved of Mr. Stagg
very much indeed.
</p>
<p>
One particularly muddy day he met the returning
hardware merchant at the gate with vociferous barkings
and a plain desire to implant a welcoming tongue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
on the man’s cheek. He succeeded in muddying Mr.
Stagg’s suit with his front paws, and almost cast the
angry man full length into a mud puddle.
</p>
<p>
“Drat the beast!” ejaculated Mr. Stagg. “I’d
rather have an epileptic fit loose around here than
him. Now, look at these clo’es! I declare, Car’lyn,
you’ve jest got to tie that mongrel up—and keep
him tied!”
</p>
<p>
“All the time, Uncle Joe?” whispered the little
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, <em>ma’am</em>, all the time! If I find him loose
again, I’ll tie a bag of rocks to his neck and drop
him in the deepest hole in the brook. He’d oughter
been drowned by that man when he was a pup.”
</p>
<p>
After this awful threat, Prince lived a precarious
existence, and his mistress was much worried for
him. Never, when Uncle Joe was at home, could
the dog have a run. Aunty Rose said nothing, but
she saw that both the little girl and her canine friend
were very unhappy.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Kennedy, however, had watched Mr. Joseph
Stagg for years. Indeed, she had known him as a
boy, long before she had closed up her own little
cottage around on the other road and come to the
Stagg place to save the hardware merchant from
the continued reign of those “trifling creatures”
of whom Mrs. Gormley had spoken.
</p>
<p>
As a bachelor, Joseph Stagg had been preyed
upon by certain female harpies so prevalent in a
country community. Some had families whom they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
partly supported out of Mr. Stagg’s larder; some
were widows who looked upon the well-to-do merchant
as a marrying proposition.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose Kennedy did not need the position of
Mr. Stagg’s housekeeper and could not be accused
of assuming it from mercenary motives. Over her
back fence she had seen the havoc going on in the
Stagg homestead after Hannah Stagg went to the
city and Joseph Stagg’s final female relative had
died and left him alone in the big house.
</p>
<p>
One day the old Quaker-like woman could stand
no more. She put on her sunbonnet, came around
by the road to the front door of the Stagg house,
which she found open, and walked through to the
rear porch on which the woman who then held
the situation of housekeeper was wrapping up
the best feather bed and pillows in a pair of the
best home-spun sheets, preparatory to their removal.
</p>
<p>
The neighbours enjoyed what followed. Aunty
Rose came through the ordeal as dignified and unruffled
as ever; the retiring incumbent went away
wrathfully, shaking the dust of the premises from
her garments as a testimony against “any sich actions.”
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Stagg came home at supper time he
found Aunty Rose at the helm and already a different
air about the place.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me, Aunty Rose,” he said, biting into
her biscuit ravenously, “I was a-going down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
mill-hands’ hotel to board. I couldn’t stand it no
longer. If you’d stay here and do for me, I’d feel
like a new man.”
</p>
<p>
“You ought to be made over into a new man,
Joseph Stagg,” the woman said sternly. “A married
man.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no! Never <em>that</em>!” gasped the hardware
dealer.
</p>
<p>
“If I came here, Joseph Stagg, it would cost you
more money than you’ve been paying these no-account
women.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” said Mr. Stagg recklessly. “Go
ahead. Do what you please. Say what you want.
I’m game.”
</p>
<p>
Thereby he had put himself into Aunty Rose’s
power. She had renovated the old kitchen and some
of the other rooms. If Mr. Stagg at first trembled
for his bank balance, he was made so comfortable
that he had not the heart to murmur. And, besides,
he believed in keeping his word. He had declared
himself “game.”
</p>
<p>
But that had all happened years before. This
matter of expense for Hannah’s Car’lyn was an entirely
different matter. Moreover, the mischievousness
of Prince, the mongrel, was really more than
Mr. Joseph Stagg thought he was called upon to
bear.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Carolyn May let Prince run at large
when she was sure Uncle Joe was well out of sight
of the house, but she was very careful to chain him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
up again long before her uncle was expected to
return.
</p>
<p>
Prince had learned not to chase anything that wore
feathers; Aunty Rose herself had to admit that he
was a very intelligent dog and knew what punishment
was for. But how did he know that in trying to
dig out a mole he would be doing more harm than
good?
</p>
<p>
The mole in question lived under a piece of rock
wall near the garden fence. When let free for his
first morning run, Prince had been much interested
in the raised roofs of the tunnels he found in the
sod down there.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose called the mole “a pesky creature.”
Uncle Joe had threatened to bring home a trap with
which to impale it. How should Prince know—and
this was the question Carolyn May asked afterwards—that
he would not be considered a general
benefactor if he managed to capture the little blind
nuisance?
</p>
<p>
At any rate, when Uncle Joe came home to dinner
on one particular Saturday he walked down to the
corner of the garden fence, and there saw the havoc
Prince had wrought. In following the line of the
mole’s last tunnel he had worked his way under the
picket fence and had torn up two currant bushes
and done some damage in the strawberry patch.
</p>
<p>
 “And the worst of it is,” grumbled the hardware
dealer, “he never caught the mole. That mongrel
really isn’t worth a bag of dornicks to sink him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
the brook. But that’s what he’s going to get this
very evening when I come home. I won’t stand for
him a day longer.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May positively turned pale as she
crouched beside the now chained-up Prince, both
arms about his rough neck. He licked her cheek.
Fortunately, he could not understand <em>everything</em>
that was said to him, therefore the pronouncement
of this terrible sentence did not agitate him an atom.
</p>
<p>
But his little mistress held to him tightly, dry sobs
shaking her slight form. Uncle Joe went in to dinner
with little appreciation of the horror and despair
that filled the soul of Hannah’s Car’lyn, out under
the tree in the back yard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—MR. STAGG IS JUDGED</h2>
<p>
First, of course, Carolyn May thought she
would run away—she and Prince. She could
not eat any dinner, although Aunty Rose
called her twice and she did feel a little faint, for
she possessed a hearty appetite. But the child knew
that the very first mouthful she tried to swallow
would choke her—and then she would cry.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Aunty Rose understood this, for she did
not trouble the little girl again. Carolyn May sat
for a long time under the tree beside the sleeping
dog and thought how different this life at The Corners
was from that she had lived with her father and
mother in the city home.
</p>
<p>
If only that big ship, the <em>Dunraven</em>, had not sailed
away with her papa and her mamma!
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had been very brave on that occasion.
She had gone ashore with Mrs. Price and
Edna after her mother’s last clinging embrace and her
father’s husky “Good-bye, daughter,” with scarcely
a tear. She had watched the huge vessel sweep off
from the dock and out into the stream, carried by
the outgoing tide and helped by a fussy tug, which
latter she had thought preposterously small to be of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
any real service to such a huge craft as the
<em>Dunraven</em>.
</p>
<p>
They had run to the very end of the pier, too; so
as to see the last of the outgoing ship. Of course,
the faces of her father and mother were lost to her
vision in the crowd of other passengers, but her
mother had waved her pink veil, as agreed, and
Carolyn May could see that for a long while.
</p>
<p>
Of course, she had been brave! Mamma would
return in a few weeks, and then, after a time, papa
would likewise come back—and, oh! so rosy and
stout! No more cough, no longer a feeble step, no
longer breathless after he had climbed the two flights
to their apartment.
</p>
<p>
These things the little girl, left behind, had fully
understood. She looked forward confidently to the
happy return of both her parents.
</p>
<p>
And then, in two weeks, came the fatal news of
the sinking of the <em>Dunraven</em> and the loss of all but
a small part of her crew and passengers. The
steamer had gone down quickly, and in the night,
with the dim coast of Africa far, far to the southward
and many, many leagues of troubled sea between
her grave and the Spanish coast.
</p>
<p>
The two warring vessels—which one had caused
the sinking of the <em>Dunraven</em> would probably never
be known—had not even discovered till daylight
that there was a remnant of the <em>Dunraven’s</em> company
adrift on the sea. These were finally rescued
by the victorious combatant, and in a heavy fog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
The exact spot where the <em>Dunraven</em> had sunk was
not known.
</p>
<p>
Vaguely these facts had become known to Carolyn
May. She never spoke of them. They did not seem
real to the little girl. After all, she could not believe
that her father and mother had gone on so long a
journey that they would never again return to
her.
</p>
<p>
But now, sitting beside the condemned Prince—her
companion and only real comforter during these
weeks of her orphanhood—the little girl felt bitterly
her loneliness and grief.
</p>
<p>
If Uncle Joe did as he had threatened, what should
she do? There seemed to be no place for her and
Prince to run away to. She did not know her way
about Sunrise Cove and The Corners. During the
weeks she had lived here she had learned to know
nobody well enough to fly to for protection, or of
whom to beg shelter for herself and her dog.
</p>
<p>
She knew Mr. Stagg to be a very firm and determined
man. Even Aunty Rose, who in most things
guided affairs at the Stagg homestead, could go only
so far. What Uncle Joe really determined to do,
not even the austere housekeeper could balk. No,
there seemed no escaping the awful tragedy that
was to be. And if Prince had to die——
</p>
<p>
“I’m quite sure I don’t want to live,” thought
Carolyn May dismally. “If papa, and mamma, and
Prince are <em>all</em> dead—why! there aren’t enough other
folks left in the world to make it worth while living
in, I don’t believe. If Prince isn’t going to be alive,
then <em>I</em> don’t want to be alive, either.”
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>
By-and-by Prince began to get very uneasy. It
was long past his dinner hour, and every time he
heard the screen door slam he jumped up and gazed
eagerly and with cocked ears and wagging tail in
that direction.
</p>
<p>
“You poor thing, you,” said Carolyn May at last.
“I s’pose you <em>are</em> hungry. It isn’t going to do you
a bit of good to eat; but you don’t know it. I’ll ask
Aunty Rose if she has something for you.”
</p>
<p>
She got up wearily and went across the yard.
Aunty Rose stood just inside the screen door.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want any dinner, Car’lyn May?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am. I guess I’d better not eat,” said
the child.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“’Cause my stomach’s so trembly. I just <em>know</em> I
couldn’t keep anything down, even if I could swallow
it. But Prince’ll eat his, please. He—he don’t
know any better.”
</p>
<p>
“Tut, tut!” murmured the woman. “He’s the
most sensible of the two of you, I declare.”
</p>
<p>
But she did not urge Carolyn May to eat. There
was a platter of broken meat and bread for the dog,
and Prince ate with apparent thankfulness.
</p>
<p>
“But you wouldn’t gobble that down so, if you
knew what was going to happen to us, you poor
dear,” Carolyn May whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
Later she took Prince around the premises on his
leash. She led him along the edge of the brook.
The Stagg place bordered on both sides of the
stream, and on the farther side were hayfields. Uncle
Joe did not till any land save the garden in which
the unhappy Prince had done such damage.
</p>
<p>
The little girl found, she believed, what must be
the deepest hole in the brook. It was not far beyond
the great, widely spreading tree on the knoll where
she loved to sit. The water was brown and cloudy
in this pool, and a trout jumped there and left a wake
of bubbles behind him where he dived again with
the luckless fly he had snapped out of the air.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if that trout will stay there if you are
drownd-ed right where he lives?” Carolyn May
asked of Prince.
</p>
<p>
Prince wagged his abbreviated tail and yawned.
Really, he seemed very little impressed by the tragic
fate that overhung him. Perhaps Carolyn May’s
feelings would have been less desperate had she been
blessed, as Prince was just then, by a full stomach.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the tragedy was all very real to the
child. She saw Aunty Rose sitting in one of her stiffest
and most straight-backed chairs on the porch,
knitting. Carolyn May would not go near her, for
she knew she would burst out crying at the first kind
word.
</p>
<p>
She had learned to love Aunty Rose. The old
lady always waited for Carolyn May to say her
prayers now, when bedtime came. And the child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
had a well-grounded suspicion that before Mrs.
Kennedy sought her own bed she crept into Carolyn
May’s room and kissed her softly and saw that she
was tucked in.
</p>
<p>
She felt that she would be sorry to leave Aunty
Rose. And there was the woman whose husband
kept the store on the other corner from the Stagg
house. <em>She</em> had given Carolyn May a stick of candy
one day.
</p>
<p>
“I expect she’ll be sorry not to see me again,” the
little girl told herself. “And there’s Mrs. Gormley—and
Chet. They’ll think it funny I didn’t bid them
good-bye. And, then, there’s Mr. Parlow.”
</p>
<p>
After all, there seemed to be quite a number of
people Carolyn May knew—“just to be acquainted
with.” But she had never yet seen the fulfilment
of her strong desire to become acquainted with the
carpenter’s daughter, Miss Amanda Parlow.
</p>
<p>
All these thoughts shuttled back and forth in
Carolyn May’s brain. The minutes of that afternoon
dragged by in most doleful procession. There
was no idea in the little girl’s mind that Uncle Joe
might change his intention and Prince be saved
from the watery grave promised him. When she
saw the hardware dealer come into the yard almost
an hour earlier than their usual supper time she was
not surprised. Nor did she think of pleading with
him for the dog’s life.
</p>
<p>
The little girl watched him askance. Mr. Stagg
came directly through the yard, stopping only at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
shed for a moment. There he secured a strong
potato sack, and with it trailing from his hand went
halfway up the knoll to where there was a heap of
stones. He stooped down and began to select some
of these, putting them in the bag.
</p>
<p>
This was too much for Carolyn May. With a
fearful look at Uncle Joe’s uncompromising shoulders,
she went to the tree where Prince was chained.
Exchanging the chain for the leather leash with
which she always led him about, the little girl guided
the mongrel across the yard and around the corner
of the house.
</p>
<p>
Her last backward glance assured her that the
hardware dealer had not observed her. Quickly
and silently she led Prince to the front gate, and they
went out together into the dusty road.
</p>
<p>
“I—I know we oughtn’t to,” whispered Carolyn
May to her canine friend, “but I feel I’ve just <em>got</em>
to save you, Prince. I—I can’t see you drownd-ed
dead like that!”
</p>
<p>
Prince whined in sympathy. Perhaps he felt, too,
that life held much that was good and beautiful to
his doggish soul.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had no idea where they should go
to hide from Uncle Joe. This venture was the result
of a sudden and unpremeditated determination. Her
only thought at first was to get out of sight of the
Stagg premises.
</p>
<p>
So she turned the nearest corner and went up the
road towards the little closed, gable-roofed cottage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
where Aunty Rose had lived before she had come to
be Uncle Joe’s housekeeper.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had already peered over into the
small yard of the cottage and had seen that Mrs.
Kennedy still kept the flower-beds weeded and the
walks neat and the grass plot trimmed. But the
window shutters were barred and the front door
built up with boards.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May went in through the front gate and
sat down on the doorstep, while Prince dropped to
a comfortable attitude beside her. The dog slept.
The little girl ruminated.
</p>
<p>
She would not go back to Uncle Joe’s—no, indeed!
She did not know just what she would do
when dark should come, but Prince should not be
sacrificed to her uncle’s wrath.
</p>
<p>
In the morning she would walk to the railroad
station. She knew how to get there, and she knew
what time the train left for the south. The conductor
had been very kind to her all the way up from
New York, and she was sure he would be glad to
take her back again.
</p>
<p>
She and Prince! They were both happier in that
small Harlem apartment, even with papa and
mamma away, than they ever could be at Sunrise
Cove. And, of course, Prince could not be happy
after he was “drownd-ed dead!”
</p>
<p>
So it all seemed to the heart-hungry child sitting
on the doorstep of the abandoned house. A voice,
low, sweet, yet startling, aroused her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing there, little girl?”
</p>
<p>
Both runaways started, but neither of them was
disturbed by the appearance of her who had accosted
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Mandy!” breathed the little girl, and
thought that the carpenter’s daughter had never
looked so pretty.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing there?” repeated Miss
Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“We—we’ve run away,” said Carolyn May at
last. She could be nothing but frank; it was her
nature.
</p>
<p>
“Run away!” repeated the pretty woman. “You
don’t mean that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. I have. And Prince. From Uncle
Joe and Aunty Rose,” Carolyn May assured her,
nodding her head with each declaration.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear! What for?” asked Miss
Amanda.
</p>
<p>
So Carolyn May told her—and with tears.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the woman came into the yard and sat
beside the child on the step. With her arm about
the little girl, Miss Amanda snuggled her up close,
wiping the tears away with her own handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
“I just <em>can’t</em> have poor Prince drownd-ed,” Carolyn
May sobbed. “I’d want to be drownd-ed myself,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“I know, dear. But do you really believe your
Uncle Joseph would do such a thing? Would he
drown your dog?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“I-I saw him putting the stones in the bag,”
sobbed Carolyn May. “And he <em>said</em> he would.”
</p>
<p>
“But he said it when he was angry, dear. We
often say things when we are angry—more’s the
pity!—which we do not mean, and for which we are
bitterly sorry afterwards. I am sure, Carolyn May,
that your Uncle Joe has no intention of drowning
your dog.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Amanda! Are you pos’tive?”
</p>
<p>
“Positive! I know Joseph Stagg. He was never
yet cruel to any <em>dumb</em> creature. Go ask him yourself,
Carolyn May. Whatever else he may be, he
is not a hater of helpless and dumb animals.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Amanda,” cried Carolyn May, with clasped
hands, “you—you are just lifting an awful big lump
off my heart! I’ll run and ask him right away.”
</p>
<p>
She put up her lips for Miss Amanda to kiss, but
she could not wait to walk properly with her new
friend to the corner. Instead, she raced with the
barking Prince back to the Stagg premises. Mr.
Stagg had just finished filling in with the stones the
trench Prince had dug under the garden fence.
</p>
<p>
“There,” he grunted. “That dratted dog won’t
dig this hole any bigger, I reckon. What’s the matter
with you, Car’lyn?”
</p>
<p>
“Are—are you going to drownd Princey, Uncle
Joe? If—if you do, it just seems to me, I—<em>I shall
die</em>!”
</p>
<p>
He looked up at her searchingly.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! is that mongrel so all-important to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
your happiness that you want to die if he does?”
demanded the man.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Uncle Joe.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” ejaculated the hardware dealer
again. “I believe you think more of that dog than
you do of me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Uncle Joe.”
</p>
<p>
The frank answer hit Mr. Stagg harder than he
would have cared to acknowledge.
</p>
<p>
“Why?” he queried.
</p>
<p>
“Because Prince never said a word to hurt me in
his life!” said Carolyn May, sobbing.
</p>
<p>
The man was silenced. He felt in his inmost
heart that he had been judged.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—PRINCE AWAKENS THE CORNERS</h2>
<p>
Camp-meeting time was over, and the
church at The Corners was to open for its
regular Sunday services.
</p>
<p>
“Both Satan and the parson have had a vacation,”
said Mr. Stagg, “and now they can tackle
each other again and see which’ll get the strangle
hold ’twixt now and revival time.”
</p>
<p>
“You should not say such things, especially before
the child, Joseph Stagg,” admonished Aunty
Rose.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May, however, seemed not to have heard
Uncle Joe’s pessimistic remark; she was too greatly
excited by the prospect of Sunday-school. And the
very next week-day school would begin!
</p>
<p>
By this first week in September the little girl was
quite settled in her new home at The Corners.
Prince was still a doubtful addition to the family,
both Uncle Joe and Aunty Rose plainly having misgivings
about him. But in regard to the little girl
herself, the hardware merchant and the housekeeper
were of one opinion, even though they did not admit
it to each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose remained, apparently, as austere as
ever, while Joseph Stagg was quite as much immersed
in business as formerly. Yet there were times,
when she and the child were alone, that Mrs. Kennedy
unbent, in a greater or less degree. And on
the part of Joseph Stagg, he found himself thinking
of sunny-haired, blue-eyed “Hannah’s Car’lyn”
with increasing frequency.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you ever have any little girls, Aunty
Rose?” Carolyn May asked the housekeeper on
one of these intimate occasions. “Or little boys?
I mean of your very own.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Aunty Rose in a matter-of-fact tone.
“Three. But only to have them in my arms for a
very little while. Each died soon after coming to
me. There was something quite wrong with them
all, so the doctors said.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear! All three of them?” sighed
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Two girls and a boy. Only one lived to be
three months old. They are all buried behind the
church yonder. My husband, Frank Kennedy, was
not one of us. I married out of Meeting.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl knew that she meant her husband,
long since dead, had not been a member of the congregation
of Friends. She leaned against Mrs.
Kennedy’s chair and tucked what was meant to be
a comforting hand into that of Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
“Now I know something about you,” Carolyn
May said softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is that?” asked the woman, her eyes
smiling at the child if her lips did not.
</p>
<p>
“I know why it is you don’t know just how to
cuddle little girls and show ’em how much you love
’em. <em>All</em> little children, I mean—not only me.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose looked down at her with unchanging
countenance, but Carolyn May looked fearlessly up
into the woman’s face. No amount of grimness
there could trouble the child now. For she knew
something else about Aunty Rose. The housekeeper
loved her!
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you didn’t have your little babies long
enough to learn how to cuddle and snug ’em up.
That’s it. You ought to learn, Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” asked Aunty Rose Kennedy rather
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Why! so you could take me up into your lap
and hug and kiss me—just as my mamma used
to do.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t teach an old dog new tricks, I guess,
Car’lyn May,” said Aunty Rose. “Seems to me
too much hugging spoils children.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, indeed!” cried the little girl confidently.
“Never! My papa used to snug me up lots. Do
you know what he used to call me?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“It was just for fun, you know. Just a pet name.
Snuggy. He ’most always called me that. ’Cause
I liked to be snuggled up.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose made no rejoinder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
The next morning early Carolyn May, with
Prince, went over into the churchyard and found
the three little stones in a row. She knew they must
be the right ones, for there was a bigger stone, with
the inscription, “Frank Kennedy, beloved spouse of
Rose Kennedy,” upon it. “Spouse” puzzled the
little girl at first, but she felt timid about asking
Aunty Rose about it.
</p>
<p>
The names on the three little stones were Emeline,
Frank, Jr., and Clarissa. Weeds and tall grass had
begun to sprout about the tombstones in the old
churchyard.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May pulled the unsightly weeds from
about the little, lozenge-shaped stones and about the
taller one, and she dug out a mullen plant that grew
on one of the graves.
</p>
<p>
While she was thus engaged, a tall man in black—looking
rather “weedy” himself, if the truth were
told—came across the graveyard and stood beside
her. He wore a broad band of crêpe around his
hat and on his arm, and was very grave and serious-looking.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you, little girl?” he asked, his voice
being quite agreeable and his tone kindly.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Car’lyn May, if you please,” she replied,
looking up at him frankly.
</p>
<p>
“Car’lyn May Stagg?” he asked. “You’re Mr.
Stagg’s little girl? I’ve heard of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Car’lyn May Cameron,” she corrected seriously.
“I’m only staying with Uncle Joe. He is my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
guardian, and he had to take me, of course, when
my papa and mamma were lost at sea.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed?” returned the gentleman. “Do you
know who I am?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I think,” said Carolyn May doubtfully,
“that you must be the undertaker.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment the gentleman looked startled.
Then he flushed a little, but his eyes twinkled.
</p>
<p>
“The undertaker?” he murmured. “Do I look
like that?”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, sir,” said Carolyn May. “I don’t
really know you, you know. Maybe you’re <em>not</em> the
undertaker.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I am not. Though our undertaker, Mr.
Snivvins, is a very good man.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said the little girl politely.
</p>
<p>
“I am the pastor here—your pastor, I hope,” he
said, putting a kind hand upon her head.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know you now!” said Carolyn May
brightly. “You’re the man Uncle Joe says is going
to get a strangle hold on Satan, now that vacation
is over.”
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Afton Driggs looked rather odd
again. The shocking frankness of the child came
pretty near to flooring him.
</p>
<p>
“I—ahem! Your uncle compliments me,” he
said drily. “You don’t know that he is ready to do
his share, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“His share?” repeated the puzzled little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Towards strangling the Evil One,” pursued the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
minister, a wry smile curling the corners of his
lips.
</p>
<p>
“Has he got a share in it, too?” asked Carolyn
May.
</p>
<p>
“I think we all should have,” said the minister,
looking down at her with returning kindliness in his
glance. “Even little girls like you.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May looked at him quite seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose,” she asked him confidentially,
“that Satan is really wicked enough to trouble little
girls?”
</p>
<p>
It was a startling bit of new philosophy thus suggested,
and Mr. Driggs shook his head in grave
doubt. But it gave him something to think of all
that day; and the first sermon preached in The
Corners church that autumn seemed rather different
from most of those solid, indigestible discourses that
the good man was wont to drone out to his parishioners.
</p>
<p>
“Dunno but it is worth while to give the parson
a vacation,” pronounced Uncle Joe at the dinner
table. “Seems to me, his sermon this morning
seemed to have a new snap to it. Mebbe he’ll give
old Satan a hard rub this winter, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Joseph Stagg!” said Aunty Rose admonishingly.
</p>
<p>
“I think he’s a very nice man,” said Carolyn
May suddenly. “And I kep’ awake most of the
time—you see, I heard poor Princey howling for me
here, where he was tied up.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” ejaculated Mr. Stagg. “Which kept
you awake—the dog or the minister?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I like Mr. Driggs very much,” the little
girl assured him. “And he’s in great ’fliction, too,
I am sure. He—he wears crêpe on his hat and
sleeve.”
</p>
<p>
“Hum, so he does,” grunted Mr. Stagg. “He’s
’most always in mourning for somebody or something.
I tell him his name ought to be Jeremiah
instead of ‘Sweet Afton,’” which comment was, of
course, lost on Carolyn May. But she said seriously:
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose, Uncle Joe, that he <em>looks up</em>
enough? It does just seem to me as though poor
Mr. Driggs must always be looking down instead of
looking up to see the sunshine and the blue sky
and—and the mountains, like my papa said you
should.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe was silent. Aunty Rose said, very
briskly for her:
</p>
<p>
“And your papa was right, Car’lyn May. He
was a very sensible man, I have no doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he was quite a <em>wonderful</em> man,” said the
little girl with full assurance.
</p>
<p>
It was on the following morning that school
opened. The Corners district school was a red
building, with a squatty bell tower and two front
doors, standing not far up the road beyond the
church. Carolyn May thought it a very odd-looking
schoolhouse indeed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
The school she had attended in New York was a
big brick-and-stone building, with wide corridors,
well-ventilated rooms, a lovely basement gymnasium,
a great hall, a roof garden in summer, part of which
was enclosed with glass and steam-heated in winter.
</p>
<p>
Inside the little red schoolhouse were only rows
of desks and “forms”—all marred, knife-marked,
and ink-stained. The initials of the very “oldest
inhabitant” of The Corners, Mr. Jackson Sprague,
were carved in the lid of one desk. And the system
of education followed in this school seemed to be
now much what it had been in Mr. Sprague’s day.
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie Lester taught the school, and although
Miss Minnie looked very sharply through
her glasses at one, Carolyn May thought she was
going to love the teacher very much.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, that was Carolyn May’s attitude towards
almost everybody whom she met. She expected to
love and to be loved. Was it any wonder she made
so many friends?
</p>
<p>
But this country school was conducted so differently
from the city school that Carolyn May found
herself quite puzzled on many points.
</p>
<p>
She had to divide her desk with another little
girl, Freda Payne. Freda was a black-eyed, snappy
little girl who could whisper out of the corner of
her mouth without the teacher’s seeing her do it.
She instructed Carolyn May from time to time regarding
this new world the city child had entered
into.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! didn’t you ever have a slate before?”
she whispered to Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“No,” the little city girl confessed. “They don’t
let us use them where I went to school. They make
too much noise. And, then, they aren’t clean.”
</p>
<p>
“Clean! Course they’re clean, if you keep ’em
clean,” declared Freda fiercely.
</p>
<p>
She showed the stranger the bottle of water she
kept in her desk and the sponge with which she
washed her slate.
</p>
<p>
“But the sponge is dirty. And it smells!” ventured
Carolyn May, with a slight shudder. She had
heard of germs, and the mussy-looking bit of sponge
was not an attractive object.
</p>
<p>
“’Tain’t neither!” snapped Freda, making her
denial positive with two negatives. “The boys spit
on their slates and wipe ’em off on their jacket
sleeves. <em>That’s</em> nasty. But us girls is clean.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May could not see it, however, and she
ignored her own slate.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t use that pencil to write with on paper,”
Freda caught her up with another admonition.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a slate pencil, if it has got wood around it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! Is it?” sighed the new pupil.
“And I haven’t any other here, that I can see.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll lend you one. But don’t chew the
lead. I hate to have folks chew my lead pencils.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May promised not to lunch off of the borrowed
writing instrument.
</p>
<p>
But these were not all the pitfalls into which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
new pupil fell. The morning session was not half
over before she wished for a drink of water. Of
course, she asked her seatmate about it.
</p>
<p>
“You must raise your hand till Miss Minnie sees
you. You’ll have to waggle your hand good to make
her look, like enough,” added Carolyn May’s mentor.
“Then, if she nods, you go back to the entry
and get your drink.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” was the comment of the city child, and she
immediately raised her hand. She did not have to
“waggle” it much before Miss Minnie took notice
of her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Carolyn May?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“May—may I get a drink—please?” almost
whispered Carolyn May, for she felt very much
embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie nodded. The little girl rose and
went back to the entry on the girls’ side of the house.
She looked all about this rather large square room
without finding what she sought.
</p>
<p>
Against two walls were rows of pegs, on which
were hung the coats and hats and dinner baskets, or
dinner pails, of the pupils. In the corner was a shelf
with a dingy bucket upon it and a rusty tin dipper
hanging beside it.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Carolyn May came slowly back to her
seat. Miss Minnie was busy with a class of older
pupils. Freda asked—of course out of the corner
of her mobile mouth:
</p>
<p>
“Did you get your drink?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see any faucet.”
</p>
<p>
“Faucet! What’s that for?” demanded the
other little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Why, to get the water out of. Isn’t there a cold-water
tank? And don’t you have paper cups?” demanded
Carolyn May. “I didn’t see a thing like
what we use in our school in New York.”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy me, Carolyn May!” fairly hissed Freda.
“What <em>are</em> you talking about? We don’t have
water laid on in the schoolhouse like they do at home.
The pump’s in the yard. And whoever heard of
paper cups? Why, paper won’t hold water!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, they do,” the other little girl said eagerly.
“They are all folded, and you take one and open
it, and it holds water.”
</p>
<p>
“I think you’re fibbing!” declared her seatmate
flatly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped the new pupil, deeply hurt by the
imputation.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do!” said Freda. “I’ve got a folding
nickel cup. But who ever heard of paper cups?
Everybody drinks out of the dipper.”
</p>
<p>
“That rusty old saucepan?” murmured Carolyn
May in wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Huh, you’re awful finicky!” scoffed the other.
</p>
<p>
“Is the water in that pail on the shelf?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And don’t you spill none, or Miss Minnie
will get mad at you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’ll wait till I get home at noon recess,”
said the little city girl. “I’m—I’m not so thirsty
now.”
</p>
<p>
There proved, too, at the start, to be a little difficulty
with Miss Minnie. Prince would not remain
at home. He howled and whined for the first half
of Monday morning’s session—as Aunty Rose confessed,
almost driving her mad. Then he slipped
his collar and tore away on Carolyn May’s cold trail.
</p>
<p>
He heard the children’s voices as they came out
of the school at recess, and charged into the group
in search of his little mistress. Carolyn May was
just getting acquainted with the other pupils of her
own age and was enjoying herself very much.
</p>
<p>
“Carolyn May,” pronounced Miss Minnie from
the girls’ door-stoop, “you must take that horrid
dog home at once! Hurry, or you will be late for
the next class.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was hurt by the teacher’s tone and
words, and she <em>knew</em> Prince felt bad about it. He
fairly slunk out of the schoolyard by her side, and
some of the pupils laughed.
</p>
<p>
She pulled his collar up a hole tighter and begged
Prince to be good and remain at home till noon.
Yet, ten minutes after the session had again opened
there sounded a rattling on the porch floor, and into
the school marched the dog, having drawn the staple
with which his chain had been fastened to the bole
of the tree in Mr. Stagg’s back yard.
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie was both alarmed and angry. Some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
of the little girls shrieked and wept when Prince
pranced over to Carolyn May’s seat.
</p>
<p>
“If you do not shut that awful dog up so that he
cannot follow you here, Carolyn May, I shall speak
to your uncle, Mr. Stagg, about it. Ugh, the ugly
beast! Take him away at once!”
</p>
<p>
This was entirely too much for the little girl’s
good temper. Her best friend, she felt, was maligned.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Minnie,” she said breathlessly, “I don’t
see how you can say Prince is ugly. I think he is
<em>beautiful</em>! And he is just as kind as he can be!”
</p>
<p>
She was so hurt and excited because her canine
friend was so disliked that she did not even cry one
tear! The teacher, remaining well out of reach of
the dog, repeated her command.
</p>
<p>
“Take that dog straight home, and don’t let him
get in this schoolhouse again! I will not allow the
other children to be so frightened.”
</p>
<p>
So Carolyn May’s schooldays at The Corners
did not begin very happily, after all. She had always
loved and been loved by every teacher she had ever
had before. But Miss Minnie seemed prejudiced
against her because of Prince.
</p>
<p>
The little girl felt bad about this, but she was of
too cheerful a temperament to droop for long under
the pressure of any trouble. The other children
liked her, and Carolyn May found plenty of playmates.
She would never loiter with them, however,
in the schoolyard at noon or after school. Instead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
she would hurry home and release poor Prince from
duress.
</p>
<p>
It had been found impossible to keep the dog on
a chain. He had almost choked himself once, and
again had torn his ears getting his collar off. So
the strong chicken coop under the big tree in the
back yard which had first been his prison was again
his cell while his little mistress was at school.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” Carolyn May said to Aunty Rose,
“we mustn’t let poor Princey know it’s because of
Miss Minnie that he has to be shut up. He might
take a dislike to her, just as she has to him; and that
would be dreadful! If she’d only let him, I know
he’d lie down right outside the schoolroom door
while I was inside, and be just as good!”
</p>
<p>
But Miss Minnie remained obdurate. She did
not like any dogs, and in her eyes Prince was especially
objectionable.
</p>
<p>
One of the bigger girls made up a rhyme about
Carolyn May and Prince, which began:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“<em>Car’lyn&nbsp;&nbsp;May&nbsp;&nbsp;had&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;mongrel&nbsp;&nbsp;dog,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its&nbsp;&nbsp;coat&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;white&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;snow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;everywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;Car’lyn&nbsp;&nbsp;went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;dog&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;sure&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;go.</em><br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“<em>It&nbsp;&nbsp;followed&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which&nbsp;&nbsp;made&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie&nbsp;&nbsp;sore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;Car’lyn&nbsp;&nbsp;tied&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;mongrel&nbsp;&nbsp;up,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;bound&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;bark&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;roar.</em>”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>
There were many more verses; the big girl was
always adding new ones.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mind it—much,” Carolyn May confessed
to Aunty Rose, “but I wouldn’t like Prince to hear
that poetry. His feelings might be hurt.”
</p>
<p>
It was on the last Friday in the month that something
happened which quite changed Miss Minnie’s
attitude towards “that mongrel.” Incidentally, The
Corners, as a community, was fully awakened from
its lethargy, and, as it chanced, like the Sleeping
Beauty and all her retinue, by a Prince.
</p>
<p>
The school session on Friday afternoons was always
shortened. This day Mr. Brady, one of the
school trustees, came to review the school and, before
he left, to pay Miss Minnie her salary for the
month.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had permission from Aunty Rose
to go calling that afternoon. Freda Payne, whom
she liked very much, lived up the road beyond the
schoolhouse, and she had invited the little city girl
to come to see her. Of course, Prince had to be
included in the invitation. Freda fully understood
that, and Carolyn May took him on his
leash.
</p>
<p>
They saw Miss Minnie at her desk when they went
past the schoolhouse. She was correcting written
exercises. Carolyn May secretly hoped that her
own was much better than she feared it was.
</p>
<p>
Not far beyond the schoolhouse Prince began to
growl, and the hairs stiffened on his neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Whatever is the matter with you, Prince?” demanded
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
In a moment she saw the cause of the dog’s continued
agitation. A roughly dressed, bewhiskered
man sat beside the road eating a lunch out of a newspaper.
He leered at Carolyn May and said:
</p>
<p>
“I guess you got a bad dog there, ain’t ye, little
girl?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! He’s us’ally very polite,” answered
Carolyn May. “You <em>must</em> be still, Prince! You
see,” she explained, “he doesn’t like folks to wear
old clothes. If—if you had on your Sunday suit, I’m
quite sure he would not growl at you.”
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t, hey?” said the man hoarsely,
licking his fingers of the last crumbs of his lunch.
“An’ suppose a feller ain’t got no Sunday suit?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, then, I s’pose Prince wouldn’t <em>ever</em> let you
come into our yard—if he was loose.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you let him loose now, little girl,” said
the fellow, getting up hurriedly, and eyeing the angry
dog askance.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, sir. We’re going visiting up the road.
Come away, Prince. I won’t let him touch you,” she
assured the man.
</p>
<p>
The latter seemed rather doubtful of her ability
to hold the dog long, and he hobbled away towards
the schoolhouse. Prince really objected to leaving
the vicinity, and Carolyn May scolded him all the
way up the road to Freda’s house.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had a very pleasant call—Freda’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
mother even approved of Prince—and it was an hour
before the two started for home. In sight of the
schoolhouse Prince gave evidence again of excitement.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what is the matter with you now,”
Carolyn May began, when suddenly she sighted what
had evidently so disturbed the dog.
</p>
<p>
A man was crouching under one of the schoolhouse
windows, bobbing up now and then to peer in.
It was the man whom they had previously seen beside
the road.
</p>
<p>
“Hush, Prince!” whispered little Carolyn May,
holding the dog by the collar.
</p>
<p>
She, too, could see through the open window.
Miss Minnie was still at her desk. She had finished
correcting the pupils’ papers. Now she had her bag
open and was counting the money Mr. Brady had
given her.
</p>
<p>
“O-o-oh!” breathed Carolyn May, clinging to
the eager dog’s collar.
</p>
<p>
The man at the window suddenly left his position
and slipped around to the door. In a moment he
appeared in the schoolroom before the startled
teacher.
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie screamed. The man, with a rough
threat, darted forward to seize her purse.
</p>
<p>
Just then Carolyn May unsnapped the leash from
Prince’s collar and let him go.
</p>
<p>
“Save Miss Minnie, Princey!” she cried after the
charging dog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
Prince did not trouble about the door. The open
window, through which the tramp had spied upon the
schoolmistress, was nearer. He went up the wall
and scrambled over the sill with a savage determination
that left no doubt whatever in the tramp’s mind.
</p>
<p>
With a yell of terror, the fellow bounded out of
the door and tore along the road and through The
Corners at a speed never before equalled in that
locality by a Knight of the Road.
</p>
<p>
Prince lost a little time in recovering his footing
and again getting on the trail of the fleeing tramp.
But he was soon baying the fellow past the blacksmith
shop and the store.
</p>
<p>
The incident called the entire population of The
Corners, save the bedridden, to the windows and
doors. For once the little, somnolent village awoke,
and, as before pointed out, a Prince awoke it.
</p>
<p>
Hiram Lardner, the blacksmith, declared afterwards
that “you could have played checkers on that
tramp’s coat tails, providin’ you could have kep’ up
with him.”
</p>
<p>
When Prince came back from the chase, however,
the tramp’s coat tails would never serve as a checkerboard,
for the dog bore one of them in his foam-flecked
jaws as a souvenir.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—A SUNDAY WALK</h2>
<p>
Really, if Prince had been a vain dog, his ego
would certainly have become unduly developed
because of this incident. The Corners,
as a community, voted him an acquisition, whereas
heretofore he had been looked upon as a good deal
of a nuisance.
</p>
<p>
After she recovered from her fright, Miss Minnie
walked home with Carolyn May and allowed
Prince’s delighted little mistress to encourage the
“hero” to “shake hands with teacher.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, you see, he’s acquainted with you, Miss
Minnie,” said Carolyn May. “He’s an awful nice
dog. You didn’t know just how nice he was before.
But I <em>am</em> glad he didn’t really bite that dirty-looking
old tramp, Miss Minnie. I expect it would have
made Prince sick. And I’m going to take that piece
of his old coat and bury it in the garden.”
</p>
<p>
Even Mr. Stagg had a good word at last to say
for Prince; for he had been coming home to supper
at the moment the dog chased the thievish tramp
through the village.
</p>
<p>
“We have too many of that gentry here because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
of the railroad. I wish he’d chase ’em all out of
town,” declared the hardware dealer.
</p>
<p>
Besides, he profited by the incident. The very
next day Miss Minnie came into his store and bought
one of the very nicest dog collars he had in stock—a
green leather one with brass rivet heads studding
it and a shiny nameplate.
</p>
<p>
The silversmith, Mr. Murchiston, took almost
a week to engrave on it:
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p><em>Prince</em></p>
<p><em>For a Brave Deed</em></p>
</div>
<p>
The next Friday noon Miss Minnie told Carolyn
May she could bring Prince to school with her—of
course, on his leash. By this time all the other pupils
had learned that, even if he did look savage, Prince
was quite as gentle and friendly as little Carolyn
May herself, and they had ceased to be afraid of
him.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon session closed at the usual recess
time, and then it was that Miss Minnie presented the
new collar to Prince, with, as Mr. Brady, the trustee,
would have said, “a few appropriate words.”
</p>
<p>
The big girl invented another verse in imitation
of “Mary’s Little Lamb,” and recited it:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘<em>What&nbsp;&nbsp;makes&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;Car’lyn&nbsp;&nbsp;so?’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;little&nbsp;&nbsp;children&nbsp;&nbsp;cry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why,&nbsp;&nbsp;Car’lyn&nbsp;&nbsp;loves&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;know,’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;doth&nbsp;&nbsp;reply.</em>”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed Carolyn May happily.
“It’s just like a party—a birthday party. We
never celebrated Prince’s birthday before, or
gave him any kind of party. But I <em>know</em> he enjoys
it.”
</p>
<p>
He certainly did seem to appreciate the honour,
and bore himself proudly with the new green collar
around his neck. Uncle Joe attached his S.P.C.A.
license tag to it, which jingled like a bangle.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was glad to see Uncle Joe do this.
Everything that Uncle Joe did which showed he
thought of something besides his business pleased
his little niece.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” she told Aunty Rose, “I know Uncle
Joe doesn’t <em>look up</em> enough. Whenever I’m in his
store I almost always see him at his desk working
at that great big book in which he keeps his
accounts.
</p>
<p>
“Chet Gormley says he always is at it—Sundays,
too. You know, Aunty Rose, he walks down to the
store every Sunday after dinner and stays till supper
time.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, child,” the housekeeper agreed.
“Joseph Stagg is completely wrapped up in his
business.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. My papa had to work hard, and awful
long hours, too. But when he was away from the
newspaper office he said he always left business behind
him. He looked up at the sky and listened to
the birds sing. Leastways,” said Carolyn May honestly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
“he listened to the sparrows quarrel. There
weren’t many other birds on our block, ’cept a parrot;
and he scolded awfully.”
</p>
<p>
At any rate, she was quite sure that Uncle Joe
ought to be interested in something besides his hardware
store. She thought about this a good deal.
And, finally, she laid an innocent little trap for
him.
</p>
<p>
Of one tenet of the Friends’ belief Aunty Rose
was thoroughly convinced: no cooking went on in
the Stagg kitchen after breakfast on the Sabbath.
Of course, they had dinner, but save for hot tea or
coffee or soup the viands at that meal and at supper
were cold.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes during the warm weather there were
heaps of Aunty Rose’s flaky-crusted apple turnovers,
baked the day before, to crumble into bowls of
creamy milk, or there were piles of lovely sandwiches
and eggs with mayonnaise, and suchlike delicacies.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose, however, removed her work apron
when the breakfast dishes were washed and put
away and the kitchen “ridded up,” and for the remainder
of Sunday she did only the very necessary
things about the house.
</p>
<p>
If she did not walk to town to attend the Friends’
Meeting House, she sat in a straight-backed chair
and read books that—to Carolyn May—looked
“awfully religious.” However, she did not make
the day of rest a nightmare to the child. The little
girl had her picture books, as well as her Sunday-school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
papers, and she could stroll about or play
quietly with Prince.
</p>
<p>
The Corners was not burdened with the arrival
of Sunday papers from the city, with their blotchy-looking
supplements and unsightly so-called “funny
sheets.” Almost everybody went to church, and all
the children to Sunday-school, which was held first.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Afton Driggs, though serious-minded,
was a loving man. He was fond of children,
and he and his childless wife gave much of their
attention to the Sunday-school. Mrs. Driggs taught
Carolyn May’s class of little girls. Mrs. Driggs
did her very best, too, to get the children to stay to
the preaching service, but Carolyn May had to confess
that the pastor’s discourses were usually hard
to understand.
</p>
<p>
“And he is always reading about the ‘Begats,’”
she complained gently to Uncle Joe as they went
home together on this particular Sunday—the one
following the presentation of Prince’s new collar—“and
I <em>can’t</em> keep interested when he does that. I
s’pose the ‘Begats’ were very nice people, but I’m
sure they weren’t related to us—they’ve all got such
funny names.”
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” ejaculated Uncle Joe, smothering a desire
to laugh. “Flow gently, sweet Afton, does
select his passages of Scripture mostly from the ‘valleys
of dry bones,’ I allow. You’ve got it about
right there, Carolyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Joe,” said the little girl, taking her courage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
in both hands, “will you do something for
me?” Then, as he stared down at her from under
his bushy brows, she added: “I don’t mean that you
aren’t <em>always</em> doing something for me—letting me
sleep here at your house, and eat with you, and all
<em>that</em>. But something special.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the ‘something special’?” asked Mr.
Stagg cautiously.
</p>
<p>
“Something I want you to do to-day. You always
go off to your store after dinner, and when you come
home it’s too dark.”
</p>
<p>
“Too dark for what?”
</p>
<p>
“For us to take a walk,” said the little girl very
earnestly. “Oh, Uncle Joe, you don’t know how
<em>dreadful</em> I miss taking Sunday walks with my papa!
Of course, we took ’em in the morning, for he had
to go to work on the paper in the afternoon, but we
did just about go <em>every</em>where.
</p>
<p>
“Sometimes,” pursued Carolyn May in reminiscence,
“we went to a very, very early morning service
in a church. It was held pertic’lar for folks that
worked at night. It wasn’t like our church where I
went to Sunday-school, for there were boys in long
dresses, and they swung little dishes on chains, with
something burning in ’em that smelled nice, and the
minister did all the talking——”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” snorted Mr. Stagg, who was just as
startled as was the Reverend Mr. Driggs by any new
idea.
</p>
<p>
“And then we walked,” sighed Carolyn May.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
“Of course, we had often to take a ride first before
we could get a place to walk in—not on pavement.
On real dirt and grass! Under the trees! Where
the birds sang! And the flowers lived! Oh, Uncle
Joe! do you know how pretty the woods are now?
The trees and bushes are all such lovely colours. I
don’t dare go very far alone—not even with Prince.
I might get lost, Aunty Rose says.
</p>
<p>
“But if you would go with me,” the little girl
added wistfully, “just this afternoon, seems to me
I wouldn’t feel so—so <em>empty</em>.”
</p>
<p>
That “empty” feeling from which the little girl
suffered when she thought of her parents and her
old life she did not often speak of. Mr. Stagg
looked down at her earnest face and saw that the
blue eyes were misty. But Carolyn May was brave.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said Uncle Joe, clearing his throat.
“If it’s going to do you any particular good, Car’lyn
May, I suppose I can take a walk with you. I expect
the chestnuts are ripe.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they <em>are</em>, Uncle Joe! And I’ve wanted to
get just a few. But whenever Princey and I go to
any of the trees near by, there are always squirrels—and
they do quarrel so! I s’pose that’s all
they’ll have to eat this winter, and maybe the winter
is going to be a hard one. That’s what Tim, the
hackman, says. I don’t want to rob the poor little
squirrels. But couldn’t we give ’em something instead
to eat, and so take a few of their nuts?”
</p>
<p>
“The squirrels always were piggish,” chuckled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
Uncle Joe. “I don’t believe they are entitled to
more’n a bushel apiece. Anyway, we’ll take a basket
with us.”
</p>
<p>
This they did. Although Aunty Rose was very
strict with herself on Sunday, she did not disapprove
of this walk. And certainly Prince did not.
</p>
<p>
Once off his chain and realising that they were
bound for the woods, he acted like a mad dog for
the first few minutes. As they crossed the already
browning fields he dashed back and forth, now far
ahead, now charging back at them as though determined
to run them down. Then he rolled on the
grass, crept on his stomach, tearing up the sod with
his strong claws, and barking with delight.
</p>
<p>
“That fool pup hasn’t got the sense he was born
with,” declared Uncle Joe, but without rancour.
</p>
<p>
“He’s just happy,” explained Carolyn May.
“You see, he’s happy for himself and happy for us,
too. So he just has to show off this way. It isn’t
really that he hasn’t good sense, Uncle Joe.”
</p>
<p>
It was a crisp day—one of those autumn days
when the tang of frost remains in the air, in spite of
all the efforts of the sun to warm it. The sumac had
blushed redly all along the hedgerows. The young
oak leaves were brown and curled. Under foot, the
dead leaves rustled and whispered. The bare-limbed
beeches looked naked, indeed, among the other trees.
Even the yellowing leaves of the chestnuts themselves
were rattling down without a breath of wind
stirring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
The jays screamed at the party as they wheeled
swiftly through the wood. Once Prince jumped a
rabbit from its form, and Uncle Joe actually urged
the excited dog in his useless chase of the frightened
creature. But Carolyn May could not approve of
that.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” she said gravely, “although it’s lots
of fun for Prince, we don’t know just how the rabbit
feels about it. Maybe he doesn’t want to run so
hard. There! Prince has given it up. I’m glad.”
</p>
<p>
She did not mind the dog’s chasing and barking
at the squirrels. They were well out of reach. One
excited squirrel leaped from a tree top into the thick
branches of another tree, sailing through the air
“just like an aeroplane.” Carolyn May had seen
aeroplanes and thought she would like to go up in
one.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” she explained, “not without somebody
who knew all about coming down again. I
wouldn’t want to get stuck up there.”
</p>
<p>
Here and there they stopped to pick up the glossy
brown chestnuts that had burst from their burrs.
That is, Carolyn May and her uncle did. Prince,
after a single attempt to nose one of the prickly
burrs, left them strictly alone.
</p>
<p>
“You might just as well try to eat Aunty Rose’s
strawberry needle cushion, Princey,” the little girl
said wisely. “You’ll have a sorer nose than Amos
Bartlett had when he tried to file it down with a
wood rasp.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” ejaculated Mr. Stagg, “whatever possessed
that Bartlett child to do such a fool trick?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, you know his nose <em>is</em> awfully big,” said
Carolyn May. “And his mother’s always worried
about it. She must have worried Amos, too, for
one day last week he went over to Mr. Parlow’s
shop, borrowed a wood rasp, and tried to file his
nose down to a proper size. And <em>now</em> he has to go
with his nose all greased and shiny till the new skin
grows back on it.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, what these kids will do!” muttered
Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
“Now, <em>I’ve</em> got big feet,” sighed Carolyn May.
“I know I have. But I hope I’ll grow up to them.
I wouldn’t want to try to pare them off to make them
smaller. If they have got such a long start ahead
of the rest of me, I really believe that the rest of me
will catch up to my feet in time, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing like being hopeful,” commented Mr.
Stagg drily.
</p>
<p>
It was just at that moment that the little girl
and the man, becoming really good comrades on this
walk, met with an adventure. At least, to Carolyn
May it was a real adventure, and one she was not to
forget for a long, long time.
</p>
<p>
Prince suddenly bounded away, barking, down
a pleasant glade, through the bottom of which flowed
a brook. Carolyn May caught a glimpse of something
brown moving down there, and she called
shrilly to the dog to come back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
</p>
<p>
“But that’s <em>some</em>body, Uncle Joe” Carolyn May
said with assurance, as the dog slowly returned.
“Prince never barks like that, unless it’s a person.
And I saw something move.”
</p>
<p>
“Somebody taking a walk, like us. Couldn’t be
a deer,” said Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Carolyn May a moment later, “I
see it again. That’s a skirt I see. Why, it’s a
lady!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg suddenly grew very stern-looking, as
well as silent. All the beauty of the day and of the
glade they had entered seemed lost on him. He
went on stubbornly, yet as though loath to proceed.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” murmured Carolyn May, “it’s Miss
Amanda Parlow! That’s just who it is!”
</p>
<p>
The carpenter’s daughter was sitting on a bare
brown log by the brook. She was dressed very prettily,
all in brown. Carolyn May had seen her that
day in church in this same pretty dress.
</p>
<p>
For some weeks Miss Amanda had been away
“on a case.” Carolyn May knew that she was a
trained nurse and was often away from home weeks
at a time. Mr. Parlow had told her about it.
</p>
<p>
The little girl wanted to speak to the pretty Miss
Amanda, but she looked again into Uncle Joe’s
countenance and did not dare.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—A CANINE INTERVENTION</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May wanted <em>awfully</em> to speak to
Miss Amanda. The brown lady with the
pretty roses in her cheeks sat on the log by
the brook, her face turned from the path Joseph
Stagg and his little niece were coming along. She
must have known they were coming down the glade
and who they were, for nobody could mistake the
identity of Prince, and the dog would not be out in
the woods with anybody but his little mistress.
</p>
<p>
Miss Parlow, however, kept her face steadily
turned in the opposite direction. And Uncle Joe
was quite as stubborn. He stared straight ahead
down the path without letting the figure on the log
get into the focus of his vision.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not see how it was possible for
two people who loved each other, or who ever had
loved each other, to act so. They must have thought
a great deal of each other once upon a time, for
Chet Gormley’s mother had said so. The very fact
that they now acted as they did proved to the observant
child that the situation was not normal.
</p>
<p>
She wanted to seize Uncle Joe’s hand and whisper
to him how pretty Miss Amanda looked. She wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
to run to the lady and talk to her. Thus far she had
found little opportunity for knowing Miss Amanda
Parlow well, although Carolyn May and the old
carpenter were now very good friends.
</p>
<p>
Hanging to Uncle Joe’s hand, but looking longingly
at the silent figure on the log, Carolyn May
was going down to the stepping-stones by which they
were to cross the brook, when, suddenly, Prince
came to a halt right at the upper end of the log and
his body stiffened.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Prince?” whispered his little mistress.
“Come here.”
</p>
<p>
But the dog did not move. He even growled—not
at Miss Amanda, of course, but at something
on the log. And it was just then that Carolyn May
wanted to scream—and she could not!
</p>
<p>
For there on the log, raising its flat, wicked head
out of an aperture, its lidless eyes glittering, and its
forked tongue shooting in and out of its jaws, was
a snake, a horrid, silent, writhing creature, the look
of which held the little girl horror-stricken and
speechless.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe glanced down impatiently, to see what
made her hold back so. The child’s feet seemed
glued to the earth. She could not take another
step.
</p>
<p>
Writhing out of the hole in the log and coiling,
as it did so, into an attitude to strike, the snake
looked to be dangerous, indeed. The fact that it
was only a large blacksnake and non-poisonous made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
no difference at that moment to the dog or to the
little girl—nor to Joseph Stagg when he saw it.
</p>
<p>
It was coiled right at Miss Amanda’s back. She
did not see it, for she was quite as intent upon keeping
her face turned from Mr. Stagg as he had been
determined to ignore her presence.
</p>
<p>
After all, it is the appearance of a snake that terrifies
some people. They do not stop to question
whether it is furnished with a poison sac or not.
The very look of the creature freezes their blood.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was shaking and helpless. Not so
Prince. He repeated his challenging growl and then
sprang at the vibrating head. Miss Amanda uttered
a stifled scream and jumped up from the log,
whirling to see what was happening behind her.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg dropped Carolyn May’s hand and
leaped forward with his walking-stick raised to
strike. But the mongrel dog was there first. He
wisely caught the blacksnake behind the head, his
strong, sharp teeth severing its vertebræ.
</p>
<p>
“Good dog!” shouted Mr. Stagg excitedly.
“Fine dog!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Amanda!” shrieked Carolyn May.
“I—I thought he was going to sting you—I did!”
</p>
<p>
She ran to the startled woman and clung to her
hand. Prince nosed the dead snake. Mr. Stagg
looked exceedingly foolish. Miss Amanda recovered
her colour and her voice simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
“What a brave dog yours is, little girl,” she said
to Carolyn May. “And I do so despise snakes!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
Then she looked directly at Mr. Stagg and bowed
gravely. “I thank you,” she said, but so coldly, so
Carolyn May thought, that her voice might have
come “just off an iceberg.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I didn’t do anything—really I didn’t,” stammered
the man. “It was the dog.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” repeated Mr. Stagg, “it was the dog.”
</p>
<p>
Both looked very uncomfortable. Joseph Stagg
began to pick up the scattered chestnuts from the
overturned basket. The lady stooped and whispered
to Carolyn May:
</p>
<p>
“Come to see me, my dear. I want to know you
better.”
</p>
<p>
“And Prince?” asked the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“And Prince, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Then she kissed Carolyn May and slipped quietly
away from the brook, disappearing very quickly in
the undergrowth. Uncle Joe stood up, with the
basket in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better call the dog away from that snake,
Car’lyn May,” he said in a strangely husky voice.
“We’ll be going.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl approved.
</p>
<p>
“You surely don’t want to eat it, Prince,” she
told her canine friend. “Snakes aren’t meat, nor
even fish. Are they, Uncle Joe?”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! what d’you s’pose they are, then?”
he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Why, they’re—they’re just insects, aren’t they?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
Not even dogs should eat them,” and she urged
Prince away from the snake.
</p>
<p>
The muscles of the “insect” still twitched, and
its tail snapped about. Prince had his doubts as to
whether it was really dead or was “playing possum.”
</p>
<p>
“Is it true, Uncle Joe,” Carolyn May asked,
“that snakes can’t really die till the sun goes down?
You see, it still wiggles. Do—do you s’pose it’s
suffering?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess Prince fixed Mr. Snake, all right, at the
first bite,” returned Mr. Stagg. “He’s dead. That
old idea about the critters holding the spark of life
till after sunset is just a superstition. We can safely
call that fellow dead and leave him.”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg and the little girl went on across the
stepping-stones, while Prince splashed through the
water. Carolyn May was thinking about Miss
Amanda Parlow, and she believed her Uncle Joe
was, too.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Joe,” she said, “would that bad old snake
have stung Miss Amanda?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? No; I reckon not,” admitted Mr. Stagg
absent-mindedly. “Blacksnakes don’t bite. A big
one like that can squeeze some.”
</p>
<p>
“But you were scared of it—like me and Prince.
And for Miss Amanda,” said Carolyn May, very
much in earnest.
</p>
<p>
“I guess ’most everybody is scared by the sight
of a snake, Car’lyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“But you were scared for Miss Amanda’s sake—just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
the same as I was,” repeated the little girl
decidedly.
</p>
<p>
“Well?” he growled, looking away, troubled by
her insistence.
</p>
<p>
“Then you don’t hate her, do you?” the child
pursued. “I’m glad of that, Uncle Joe, for I like
her very much. I think she’s a beautiful lady.”
</p>
<p>
To this Uncle Joe said nothing. He was not to
be drawn, badger-like, to the mouth of his den.
What he really thought of Miss Amanda he kept to
himself.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” sighed Carolyn May at last, “she
invited me to come to see her, now she’s home from
nursing. And, if you haven’t got any objection,
Uncle Joe, I’m going to see her.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead,” said Mr. Stagg. “I haven’t anything
to say against it.”
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May was far from satisfied by this
permission. Child as she was, somehow she had
gained an appreciation of the tragedy in the lives of
Joseph Stagg and Amanda Parlow.
</p>
<p>
That cry the man had uttered when he sprang to
Miss Parlow’s aid had been wrenched from the very
depths of his being. Nor had Miss Amanda’s emotion
been stirred only by the sight of a snake that
was already dead when she had first seen it. Carolyn
May had felt the woman’s hand tremble; there
had been tears flooding her eyes when she kissed the
little girl.
</p>
<p>
“I guess,” thought Carolyn May wisely, “that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
when two folks love each other and get angry, the
love’s there just the same. Getting mad doesn’t kill
it; it only makes ’em feel worse.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Uncle Joe! Poor Miss Amanda! Maybe
if they’d just try to <em>look up</em> and look for brighter
things, they’d get over being mad and be happy
again.”
</p>
<p>
She felt that she would really like to advise with
somebody on this point. Aunty Rose, of course, was
out of the question. She knew that people often
advised with their minister when they were in
trouble, but to Carolyn May Mr. Driggs did not
seem to be just the person with whom to discuss a
love-affair. Kindly as the minister was disposed, he
lacked the magnetism and sympathy that would urge
one to take him into one’s confidence in such a delicate
matter.
</p>
<p>
The little girl quite realised that it was delicate.
She longed to help her uncle and Miss Amanda and
to bring them together, but she felt, too, that whatever
she did or said might do more harm than
good.
</p>
<p>
When Uncle Joe and Carolyn May returned from
this adventurous walk, Mr. Stagg went heavily into
his own room, closed the door, and even locked it.
He went over to the old-fashioned walnut bureau
that stood against the wall between the two windows,
and stood before it for some moments in an attitude
of deep reflection. Finally, he drew his bunch of
keys from his pocket and opened one of the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
small drawers in the heavy piece of furniture—the
only locked drawer there was.
</p>
<p>
It contained a miscellaneous collection of odds
and ends—old school exercises, letters from his sister
Hannah, an old-fashioned locket containing locks of
his mother’s and of his father’s hair, broken trinkets,
childish keepsakes. Indeed, such sentimental remembrances
as Joseph Stagg possessed were secreted
in this drawer.
</p>
<p>
From beneath all this litter he drew forth a tintype
picture, faded now, but clear enough to show
him the features of the two individuals printed on
the sensitised plate.
</p>
<p>
He remembered as keenly as though it were yesterday
when and how the picture had been made—at
the county fair so many years ago. His own eyes
looked out of the photograph proudly. They were
much younger eyes than they were now.
</p>
<p>
And the girl beside him in the picture! Sweet as
a wild rose, Mandy Parlow’s lovely, calm countenance
promised all the beauty and dignity her matured
womanhood had achieved.
</p>
<p>
“Mandy! Mandy!” he murmured over and over
again. “Oh, Mandy! Why? Why?”
</p>
<p>
He held the tintype for a long, long time in his
hand, gazing on it with eyes that saw the vanished
years rather than the portraits themselves. Finally,
he hid the picture away again, closed and locked the
drawer with a sigh, and with slow steps left the
room.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—CHET GORMLEY TELLS SOME NEWS</h2>
<p>
It was when she came in sight of the Parlow
place on Monday afternoon, she and Prince,
that Carolyn May bethought her of the very
best person in the world with whom to advise upon
the momentous question which so troubled her.
</p>
<p>
Who could be more interested in the happiness of
Miss Amanda than Mr. Parlow himself? If his
daughter had loved Uncle Joe and still loved him,
it seemed to Carolyn May as though the carpenter
should be very eager, indeed, to help overcome the
difficulty that lay between the two parted lovers.
</p>
<p>
The little girl had been going to call on Miss
Amanda. Aunty Rose had said she might, and Miss
Amanda had invited her “specially.”
</p>
<p>
But the thought of taking the old carpenter into
her confidence and advising with him delayed that
visit. Mr. Parlow was busy on some piece of cabinet
work, but he nodded briskly to the little girl when
she came to the door of the shop and looked in.
</p>
<p>
“Are you very busy, Mr. Parlow?” she asked
him after a watchful minute or two.
</p>
<p>
“My hands be, Car’lyn May,” said the carpenter
in his dry voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“But I kin listen to ye—and I kin talk.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s nice! You can talk when you are
sawing and fitting things, can’t you? Not like when
you are nailing. Then your mouth’s full of nails—like
Mrs. Gormley’s is full of pins when she’s fitting
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Miz Gormley never fitted me to nothin’ yet,”
returned Mr. Parlow grimly, “less ’twas a suit of
gossip.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not notice this remark, nor
would she have understood it. She thought Chet
Gormley’s mother a very interesting woman, indeed.
She always knew so much about everybody.
</p>
<p>
Just now, moreover, Carolyn May had something
else in her mind; so she ignored Mr. Parlow’s remark
about the seamstress. She asked in a half-whisper:
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Parlow, did you hear about what happened
yesterday?”
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” he queried, eyeing her quizzically.
“Does anything ever happen on Sunday?”
</p>
<p>
“Something did on this Sunday,” cried the little
girl. “Didn’t you hear about the snake?”
</p>
<p>
“What d’ye mean—snake? The old original
snake—that sarpint ye read about in the Scriptures?”
demanded the carpenter, ruffling up his grey
hair till it looked like the topknot of a very cross
cockatoo.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Mr. Parlow!” and then little Carolyn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
May explained. She told the story with such earnestness
that he stopped working to listen, watching her
with as shrewd, sharp eyes as ever a real cockatoo
possessed.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” was his grunted comment at the end.
“Well!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think that was real exciting?” asked
Carolyn May. “And just see how it <em>almost</em> brought
my Uncle Joe and your Miss Amanda together.
Don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow actually jumped. “What’s that you
say, child?” he rasped out grimly. “Bring Mandy
and Joe Stagg together? Well, I guess not!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Parlow, don’t you think that would be
just be-a-<em>you</em>-ti-ful?” cried the little girl with a lingering
emphasis upon the most important word.
“Don’t you see how happy they would be?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know who told you they’d be happy?”
he demanded crossly.
</p>
<p>
“Why! wouldn’t they be? If they truly love each
other and could get over being mad?”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” growled Mr. Parlow, “you let their
‘mad’ alone. ’Tain’t none of your business.” Mr.
Parlow was really all ruffled up, just as though he
were angry at Carolyn May’s suggestion. “I don’t
know as anybody’s pertic’lar anxious to see that
daughter of mine and Joe Stagg friendly again. No
good would come of it.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May looked at him sorrowfully. Mr.
Parlow had quite disappointed her. It was plain to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
be seen that he was not the right one to advise with
about the matter. The little girl sighed.
</p>
<p>
“I really did s’pose you’d want to see Miss
Amanda happy, Mr. Parlow,” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Happy? Bah!” snarled the old man, setting
vigorously to work again. He acted as if he wished
to say no more, and let the little girl depart without
another word.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May really could not understand it—at
least, she could not immediately. It seemed the
most natural thing in the world for Mr. Parlow to
wish to see his daughter happy and content.
</p>
<p>
And the little girl knew that Miss Amanda was
not happy. As she became better and better acquainted
with the woman whom she thought so beautiful
she was more and more convinced that the carpenter’s
daughter was not of a cheerful spirit.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jedidiah Parlow did not seem to care in the
least. That must be, Carolyn May told herself,
because he was under the influence of the Dark Spirit
himself. He was always looking down. Like Mr.
Stagg, the old carpenter was immersed in his daily
tasks and seldom thought of anything else.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he doesn’t even know what it means to be
happy!” thought Carolyn May. “He never looks
<em>up</em>, or <em>out</em>, or <em>away</em> from his carpenter’s bench.
Dear me! of course he isn’t interested in Uncle Joe
and Miss Amanda’s being in love.”
</p>
<p>
That Mr. Parlow might have a selfish reason for
desiring to keep his daughter and Joseph Stagg apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
did not enter the little girl’s mind. She was too
young to appreciate such a situation as that might
suggest.
</p>
<p>
After that Sunday walk, however, Carolyn May
was never so much afraid of her uncle as before.
Why, he had even called Prince “good dog”!
Truly, Mr. Joseph Stagg was being transformed—if
slowly.
</p>
<p>
He could not deny to himself that, to a certain
extent, he was enjoying the presence of his little niece
at The Corners. If he only could decide just what
to do with the personal property of his sister Hannah
and her husband down in the New York apartment.
Never in his life had he been so long deciding a
question. He could not bring himself to the point
of writing the lawyer either to sublet the furnished
apartment or to sell the furniture in it. Nor could
he decide to go down himself to sort over Hannah’s
little treasures, put the remainder in an auction room,
and close up the apartment.
</p>
<p>
He had really loved Hannah. He knew it now,
did Joseph Stagg, every time he looked at the lovely
little child who had come to live with him at The
Corners. Why! just so had Hannah looked when
she was a little thing. The same deep, violet eyes,
and sunny hair, and laughing lips——
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg sometimes actually found a reflection
of the cheerful figure of “Hannah’s Car’lyn” coming
between him and the big ledger over which he
spent so many of his waking hours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
Once he looked up from the ledger—it was on a
Saturday morning—and really did see the bright
figure of the little girl standing before him. It was
no dream or fancy, for old Jimmy, the cat, suddenly
shot to the topmost shelf, squalling with wild abandon.
Prince was nosing along at Carolyn May’s
side.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” croaked Mr. Stagg. “That dog of
yours, Car’lyn May, will give Jimmy a conniption
fit yet. What d’you want down here?”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May told him. A man had come to the
house to buy a cow, and Aunty Rose had sent the
little girl down to tell Mr. Stagg to come home and
“drive his own bargain.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” said Mr. Stagg, locking the ledger
in the safe, “I’ll hustle right out and tend to it.
Don’t see why the man couldn’t have waited till
noontime. Hey, you, Chet!”
</p>
<p>
Chet Gormley was not down in the cellar on this
occasion. He appeared, wearing a much soiled
apron, and with very black hands, having been sorting
bolts.
</p>
<p>
“Here I am, Mr. Stagg,” said the boy cheerfully.
“Mornin’, Car’lyn May. And how’s our
friend?” and he ventured to pat Prince’s head,
having become well acquainted with the dog by
this time.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind that dog, Chet,” said Mr. Stagg.
“You pay attention to me. Look out for the store.
Don’t have any fooling. And——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, uncle! may I stay, too? Me and Prince?”
cried Carolyn May. “We’ll be good.”
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw! Yes, if you want to,” responded Mr.
Stagg, hurrying away. He did not wish to be
bothered with her just then. He desired to walk
rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Chet went to wash his hands and remove the
apron. If he was to act as clerk instead of chore
boy, he certainly must “dress the part.” Besides,
he did not want to be so dirty in Carolyn May’s presence.
It seemed to Chet Gormley as though a boy
must look his very best to be worthy of companionship
with the radiant little vision that Mr. Stagg
referred to as “Hannah’s Car’lyn.”
</p>
<p>
“My! your uncle’s changin’ more and more, ain’t
he?” remarked Chet, the optimistic. “He does
sometimes almost laugh, Car’lyn. I never see the
beat of it!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, is he?” cried the little child. “Is he <em>looking
up</em> more? Do you think he is, Chet?”
</p>
<p>
“I positively do,” Chet assured her.
</p>
<p>
“And he hasn’t always got his nose in that old
ledger?”
</p>
<p>
“Well—I wouldn’t say that he neglected business,
no, ma’am,” said the boy honestly. “You see, we
men have got to think of business mostly. But he
sure is thinkin’ of some other things, too—ya-as,
indeedy!”
</p>
<p>
“What things, Chet?” Carolyn May asked
anxiously, hoping that Uncle Joe had shown some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
recovered interest in Miss Amanda and that Chet
had noticed it.
</p>
<p>
“Why—well—Now, you see, there’s that house
you used to live in. You know about that?”
</p>
<p>
“What about it, Chet?” the little girl asked
rather timidly. “Do you mean where I lived with
my mamma and papa before they—they went
away?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. That’s the place.”
</p>
<p>
“It was an apartment,” explained Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. Well, Mr. Stagg ain’t never done nothin’
about it. He ain’t sold it, nor sold the furniture, nor
nothin’. You know, Car’lyn May, your folks didn’t
leave you no money.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Didn’t they?” cried Carolyn May, greatly
startled.
</p>
<p>
“No. You see, I heard all about it. Mr. Vickers,
the lawyer, came in here one day, and your uncle read
a letter to him out loud. I couldn’t help but hear.
The letter was from another lawyer and ’twas all
about you and your concerns. I heard it all,” said
the quite innocent Chet. He had never been taught
that it was wrong to listen to other people’s private
matters and to repeat them.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May’s lips expressed a round “O” of
wonder and surprise. Like his mother, Chet Gormley
did not have to be urged when he was telling a
bit of news. He was too deeply interested in it
himself.
</p>
<p>
“And Mr. Vickers says: ‘So the child hasn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
anything of her own, Joe?’” Chet went on. “And
your uncle says: ‘Not a dollar, ’cept what I might
sell that furniture for,’ And he hasn’t sold it yet,
I know. He just can’t make up his mind to do it,
it seems.
</p>
<p>
“My maw says Mr. Stagg always was that way—that
he hates to let go of anything he once gets in
his hands. But it ain’t that, I tell her,” declared
Chet. “It’s just that he can’t make up his mind to
sell them things that was your mother’s, Car’lyn
May,” added the boy, with a deeper insight into
Mr. Stagg’s character than one might have given him
credit for possessing.
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May had heard some news that impressed
her more deeply than this idiosyncrasy of
Joseph Stagg’s. It made her suddenly quiet, and
she was glad a customer came into the store just
then to draw Chet Gormley’s attention.
</p>
<p>
The child had never thought before about how
the good things of life came to her—her food,
clothes, and lodging. She had never heard much
talk of ways and means at home between her father
and mother. When she had come to her uncle, if
she had thought about it at all, she had supposed
her parents had left ample means for her support,
even if Uncle Joe did “take her home and look out
for her,” as she had suggested to him at their first
interview.
</p>
<p>
But, now, Chet Gormley’s chattering had given
her a new view of the facts of the case. There had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
been no money left to spend for her needs. Uncle
Joe was just keeping her out of charity!
</p>
<p>
“And Prince, too,” thought the little girl, with a
lump in her throat. “<em>He</em> hasn’t got any more home
than a rabbit! And Uncle Joe don’t really like
dogs—not even now.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” pursued Carolyn May. “It’s
awful hard to be an orphan. But to be a <em>poor</em>
orphan—just a charity one—is a whole lot worse,
I guess.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, uncles aren’t like little girls’ <em>real</em>
parents. Papas and mammas are glad, I guess, to
pay for clothes and food and schoolbooks, and
<em>every</em>thing. But if a little girl is only a charity
orphan, there aren’t really any folks that want to
support her. I wonder if I ought to stay with Uncle
Joe and Aunty Rose and make them so much
trouble?”
</p>
<p>
The thought bit deep into the little girl’s very
impressionable mind. The idle chatter of the not
very wise, if harmless, Chet Gormley was destined
to cause Carolyn May much perturbation of spirit.
</p>
<p>
She did not remain at the store until her uncle
returned. Chet urged her to stay and go home with
him for dinner when Mr. Stagg came back, but the
little girl did not feel that she could do this. She
wished to be alone and to think over this really tragic
thing that faced her—the ugly fact that she was a
“charity child.”
</p>
<p>
“And you’re a charity dog, Prince Cameron,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
she said aloud, looking down at the mongrel who
walked sedately beside her along the country road.
“I don’t expect you ever thought of it. You never
did have any money, and you don’t really know who
your parents are. You began being a charity dog
so early that it hasn’t never mattered to you at all—that’s
how I s’pose it must be.
</p>
<p>
“And, then, you were always loved. Papa loved
you, and so did mamma; and, of course, I always
loved you to death, Princey!” she cried, putting both
arms suddenly around the dog’s neck.
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess that’s where it must be,” pursued
Carolyn May. “If persons are only loved, it doesn’t
matter if they are charity. The love takes all the
sting out of being poor, I guess. But I don’t know
if Uncle Joe just does love me or not.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl had loitered along the road until
it was now dinner time. Indeed, Aunty Rose would
have had the meal on the table twenty minutes
earlier. Mr. Stagg had evidently remained at The
Corners to sell the cow and eat dinner, too—thus
“killing two birds with one stone.”
</p>
<p>
And here Carolyn May and Prince were at Mr.
Parlow’s carpenter shop, just as the old man was
taking off his apron preparatory to going in to his
dinner. When Miss Amanda was away nursing, the
carpenter ate at a neighbour’s table.
</p>
<p>
Now, Miss Amanda appeared on the side porch.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going, little girl?” she asked,
smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
“Home to Aunty Rose,” said Carolyn May
bravely. “But I guess I’m late for dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know but something had happened,”
said Mr. Parlow, going, heavy-footed, up the porch
steps, “when I seen Joe Stagg hikin’ by more’n two
hour ago.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May told about the man wanting to buy
the cow. Mr. Parlow sputtered something from
the depths of the wash-basin about the buyer “payin’
two prices for the critter, if he bought her of Joe
Stagg,” but his daughter hastened to cover this by
saying:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want to come in and eat with us,
Carolyn May? Your own dinner will be cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, may I?” cried the little girl. Somehow,
she did not feel that she could face Uncle Joe just
now with this new thought that Chet Gormley’s
words had put into her heart. Then she hesitated,
with her hand on the gate latch.
</p>
<p>
“Will there be some scraps for Prince?” she
asked. “Or bones?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe I can find something for Prince,”
Miss Amanda replied. “I owe him more than one
good dinner, I guess, for killing that snake. Come
in, and we will see.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl at once became more cheerful. She
washed her hands and face at the pump bench, as
had Mr. Parlow. She found his big spectacles for
him (Miss Amanda declared he always managed to
lose them when he took them off); and Carolyn May
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
wiped the lenses, too, before the carpenter set them
on his nose again.
</p>
<p>
“There! I believe I kin see good for the first
time to-day,” he declared. “I reckon I could have
seen my work better all the forenoon if I’d had my
specs polished up that-a-way. You air a spry young’un,
Carolyn May.”
</p>
<p>
With this heart-warming word of approval, they
went in to dinner. Miss Amanda was already “dishing up.”
Unlike the custom at the Stagg house, the
Parlows ate in the dining-room. The kitchen was
small.
</p>
<p>
It seemed quite like old times to Carolyn May.
Miss Amanda’s way of setting the table and serving
the food was like her mamma’s way. There were
individual bread-and-butter plates, and a knife for
one’s butter and another for one’s meat, and several
other articles of table furnishings that good Aunty
Rose knew nothing about.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May thought that Miss Amanda, in her
house dress and ruffled apron, with her sleeves turned
back above her dimpled, brown elbows, was prettier
than ever. Miss Amanda had retained her youthfulness
to a remarkable degree. Although she was
quiet, there was a sparkle in her brown eyes, and a
brisk note in her full, contralto voice that charmed
the little girl. Her cheerful observations quite enlivened
Carolyn May again.
</p>
<p>
Even Mr. Parlow proved to be amusing when he
was “warmed up.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“So you didn’t want to go home with Chet Gormley
for dinner, eh?” he repeated. “Mebbe you
thought Chet wouldn’t leave nothin’ for anybody
else to eat?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Mr. Parlow, it wasn’t that!” Carolyn
May said, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
“But it might ha’ been,” chuckled the carpenter,
“if you’d ever seen Chet eat.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, father!” admonished Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“Never did see him eat, did you?” pursued the
carpenter, still chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal, he’s holler to his heels, and it’s an all-fired
long holler, at that! Chet worked for Deacon Allbright,
out on the South Road, ’fore he went to
Stagg’s store. He only worked there part of a season,
for he an’ the deacon couldn’t get along—no
more’n twin brothers,” declared Mr. Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“Fust place, the deacon is <em>rayther</em> near—has
enough on the table to eat, but jest enough, an’ that’s
all. One o’ them tables where there ain’t no scrapin’s
for ary cat or dog when the folks is through.
But, to hear Deacon Allbright ask a blessin’ on it,
you’d think ev’ry meal was a banquet.
</p>
<p>
“Wal, Chet was a boy, an’ he was tearin’ hungry,
I reckon, when he got to the table, and the deacon’s
long-winded prayers was too much for Chet’s appetite.
With the dinner dished up and his plate full,
that poor hungry little snipe had to wait while the
deacon filled his mouth with big words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“An’ one day at dinner, when they had some visitors,”
chuckled Mr. Parlow, “it got too much for
Chet Gormley. Ha’f-way through the deacon’s
blessin’ the boy began to eat. I spect he couldn’t
help it. The deacon didn’t have his eyes shut very
tight, an’ he seen him, and frowned.
</p>
<p>
“But that didn’t make no manner o’ odds to Chet.
He’d got a taste, and his appetite was whetted. He
begun mowin’ away like a good feller. With righteous
indignation, the deacon cleared his throat, and
then ended his long prayer with this:
</p>
<p>
“An’ for what we air about to receive, <em>and for
what Chet Gormley has already received</em>, let us be
truly grateful.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May laughed politely, but she could sympathise
with poor Chet. He did look hungry, he
was so long and lathlike. So they chatted throughout
the meal, and the little girl began to feel better
in her mind.
</p>
<p>
“I think you are lovely, Miss Amanda,” she said
as she helped wipe the dishes after the carpenter
had gone back to the shop. “I shall always love
you. I guess that anybody who ever <em>did</em> love you
would keep right on doing so till they died! They
just couldn’t help it!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, that is a compliment!” laughed Miss
Amanda. “You think if I once made friends I
couldn’t lose them?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure they’d always love you—<em>just the same</em>,”
repeated Carolyn May earnestly. She had Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
Joe in mind now. “How could they help doing it?
Even if—if they didn’t darest show it.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Miss Amanda, looking at
her curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ma’am. Maybe they wouldn’t darest show
it,” said the little girl confidently. “But they’d just
have to love you. You must be a universal fav’rite,
Miss Amanda.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed?” said the woman, laughing again, yet
with something besides amusement expressed in her
countenance. “And how about you, Chicken Little?
Aren’t you universally beloved, too?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t expect so, Miss Amanda,” said the
child. “I wish I was.”
</p>
<p>
“Why aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I—Well, I guess it’s just because I’m not,”
Carolyn May said desperately. “You see, after all,
Miss Amanda, I’m only a charity child.”
</p>
<p>
“A <em>what</em>?” gasped Miss Amanda, almost dropping
the salad dish she was herself wiping. “What
are you, child?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m charity,” Carolyn May repeated, having
hard work to choke back the tears. “You know—my
papa and mamma—didn’t—didn’t leave any
money for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my child!!” exclaimed Miss Amanda.
“Who told you that?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I just heard about it,” confessed the little
visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Not from Aunty Rose Kennedy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
“Did that—Did your uncle tell you such a
thing?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no! He’s just as good as he can be. But,
of course, he doesn’t much like children. You know
he doesn’t. And he just ’bominates dogs!
</p>
<p>
“So, you see,” added the child, “I <em>am</em> charity.
I’m not like other little girls that’s got papas and
mammas. Course, I knowed that before, but it
didn’t ever seem—seem so hard as it does now,”
she confessed, with a sob.
</p>
<p>
“My dear! my dear!” cried Miss Amanda, dropping
on her knees beside the little girl, “don’t talk
so! I know your uncle must love you.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose so?” queried Carolyn May, trying
not to cry.
</p>
<p>
“He <em>must</em>! How could he help loving you?
Immersed as Joseph Stagg is in business and his own
selfish projects, he cannot be so hard-hearted as not
to love his only sister’s child.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May clutched at her, suddenly and
tightly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Mandy!” she gasped, “don’t you
s’pose he loves other folks, too? You know—folks
he’d begun to love ever so long ago?”
</p>
<p>
The woman’s smooth cheeks burned suddenly,
and she stood up.
</p>
<p>
“I’m ’most sure he’d never stop loving a person,
if he’d once begun to love ’em,” said Carolyn May,
with a high opinion of the faithfulness of Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
Joe’s character. “But how do I know he ever has
loved me the least tiny bit?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda was evidently impressed by this
query. How could the child be sure? Mr. Stagg
was not in the habit of revealing his deeper thoughts
and feelings to the world. And, yet, if she would
but admit it, Amanda Parlow believed that she, if
any person could, rightly measured the hardware
dealer’s character.
</p>
<p>
She sat down in a low rocking-chair and drew
Carolyn May into her lap. The little girl sobbed a
bit, but rested her head quietly on the woman’s
bosom.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want to know if your Uncle Joe loves
you?” she asked Carolyn May at last. “Do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do!” cried the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Then ask him,” advised Miss Amanda. “That’s
the only way to do with Joe Stagg, if you want to get
at the truth. Out with it, square, and ask him.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Mandy! would <em>you</em> dare?” gasped
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t matter what I’d dare,” said the other
drily. “You go ahead and ask him—and ask him
point-blank.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do it,” Carolyn May said seriously.
Afterwards she wondered if that were not the way,
too, to settle the difficulty between Uncle Joe and
pretty Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
After the child had gone the woman went back
into the little cottage, and her countenance did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
wear the farewell smile that Carolyn May had
looked back to see.
</p>
<p>
Gripping at her heart was the old pain she had
suffered years before, and the conflict that had
scared her mind so long ago was roused again.
Time, if not the great physician for all wounds,
surely dulls the ache of them. Miss Amanda’s emotions
had been dulled during the years which had
passed since she and Joseph Stagg had broken their
troth. Carolyn May—surely with the best intentions
in the world—had rasped this wound. The
woman sat in the kitchen rocker and wrung her hands
tightly as she thought.
</p>
<p>
How peacefully, how beautifully, her life had begun!
She had bloomed into young womanhood and
had met every prospect of happiness on its threshold.
She had loved and had been loved. She had
been as sure of her lover’s heart in those days as she
was of her own.
</p>
<p>
Then had come the crash of all her hopes and
all her believing. Too proud to demand an explanation
of her lover, too much her father’s daughter
to show Joseph Stagg what she really felt and suffered,
Amanda Parlow had gone her way, not steeling
her heart to tenderness, but striving to satisfy its
longings with a work which, after all, she realised
was a thankless task.
</p>
<p>
She lavished her sympathy on the afflicted; but,
deep in her soul, she felt no satisfaction in this. She
felt that the higher qualities of her nature were not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
developed. She craved that satisfaction in life which
a woman finds in a home, in a husband, and in little
children.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe! Oh, Joe! How could you?” she
moaned, rocking herself to and fro. “How could
you?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—BREAKING THROUGH</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May always spent a part of each
Saturday afternoon, unless it rained, in the
neglected graveyard behind The Corners
church. One might think that this was not a very
cheerful spot for a little girl—and a dog—at any
time. But the little girl, as a usual thing, carried her
own cheerfulness with her.
</p>
<p>
Even on this day, when Chet Gormley’s ill-advised
gossip had so smitten her with secret grief, she would
not let the burden she carried utterly quench her
spirit. She was brave.
</p>
<p>
She did not tell Aunty Rose where she was going,
although she reported her return from Sunrise Cove
to that good woman and explained where she had
stopped for dinner.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, with Jedidiah Parlow and his daughter!
I would not tell Joseph Stagg about it, if I
were you, child,” was Aunty Rose’s comment.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had no intention of speaking to
Uncle Joe about her visit to the carpenter and Miss
Amanda; yet, having sounded the hardware dealer
on that point before, she did not think he would
really mind if she called on the “pretty lady.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
There was something else—something very much
more important—that she desired to talk to Uncle
Joe about, and she was thinking very hard over it
as she trimmed the long grass about the three little
baby graves in the Kennedy lot and about the longer
grave of Aunty Rose’s husband.
</p>
<p>
“Now I have caught the culprit,” said a voice
behind her, and Carolyn May looked up to see the
Reverend Afton Driggs smiling down at her.
</p>
<p>
“It had begun to puzzle me why this little patch
of our old graveyard looked so much better than the
rest. I might have known you had something to do
with it,” went on the minister.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May sighed. “I just wish I could clean
up all this cemetery. I think, maybe, it would please
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Please whom?” asked the minister rather
startled.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the folks that are buried here! I suppose
they must know about it. Their spirits, of course—the
parts of ’em that keep on living. I should think
it would please ’em if their graves were kept neat.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Driggs looked thoughtfully about the untidy
graveyard.
</p>
<p>
“It would seem as though ‘out of sight is out of
mind’ in many cases of old graveyards, Carolyn
May. Yes, you are right. Families move away or
die out entirely. The burial lots are left to the mercy
of strangers.
</p>
<p>
“‘Brother, keep my memory green!’ And we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
forget the friend who has really meant much to us—or,
perhaps, we beflower the grave once a year. But
that does not keep his memory green; it is only a
salve to our own consciences. Perhaps Memorial
Day is of doubtful value, after all.”
</p>
<p>
Probably Carolyn May had not heard the clergyman’s
comment. Surely, she had not understood it.
But she said now:
</p>
<p>
“Yes. There’s Miss Wade—over yonder.”
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” exclaimed the minister, turning quickly,
expecting to see the person of whom Carolyn May
spoke. “There’s who?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Wade. Or, I s’pose she was a miss. She’s
not a ‘spouse,’ or a ‘beloved relict,’ or ‘wife of the
above.’ So, I guess, she was a maiden lady.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated the clergyman. “That old
stone in the corner?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. That leany one. You know it says:
‘Lydia Wade. Died of smallpox. <em>Anno Domini</em>,
1762.’
</p>
<p>
“I know what <em>anno Domini</em> means. It’s after the
birth of Christ. I thought, at first, it was the name
of somebody else buried in the same grave—and
that he had smallpox, too.
</p>
<p>
“It must be dreadful to have smallpox and be
buried off in one corner of the graveyard by one’s
self. Do you s’pose they did that to Miss Wade
’cause they were ’fraid of other folks here catching
it?”
</p>
<p>
“It might be, my dear,” said the clergyman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
“But she was buried a long, long time ago. Probably
before there was any church here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess Miss Wade was buried—poor
thing!—so long ago that there isn’t any danger of
catching the smallpox from her,” sighed the little
girl, yet with relief in her tone. “Anyway, I’m not
afraid, for I’ve been vaccernated, and it <em>took</em>!”
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Afton Driggs thought this a rather
gruesome subject for Carolyn May; but, with the
latter, everything worth talking about at all could
be given a cheerful atmosphere. She got to her feet
with a sigh of satisfaction, and Prince awakened out
of his doze in the shelter of the wall.
</p>
<p>
“There! I spect this is the last chance I’ll have
to clean up this place ’fore snow flies. Tim, the
hackman, says it is bound to snow soon, and the frost
<em>has</em> burned ’most all the grass.”
</p>
<p>
“I presume winter is almost upon us,” agreed Mr.
Driggs. “Does the thought of it make you unhappy?”
</p>
<p>
“Me? Oh, no, Mr. Driggs! I guess we can be
just as happy in winter as in summer—or fall—or
spring. All we’ve got to do is to look <em>up</em>, and not
<em>down</em>, all the time. See how blue the sky is! And
there are wild geese flying over, aren’t there?” she
cried.
</p>
<p>
“Why, even the wild geese must <em>look up</em>, Mr.
Driggs. They’re looking for where it’s going to be
warm weather, with the streams and ponds open, I
s’pose. So, after all, I guess they’re wiser than some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
human folks, even if they are geese. Don’t you
think so?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you, Carolyn May,” cried the minister,
taking her little hand in his own as they walked
out of the churchyard.
</p>
<p>
Tim, the hackman, was a true weather prophet.
That very night the first snow flurry of the season
drove against the west window panes of the big
kitchen at the Stagg homestead. It was at supper
time.
</p>
<p>
“I declare for’t,” said Mr. Stagg, “I guess winter’s
onto us, Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“It has made an early start,” agreed the housekeeper.
“I trust you have made everything snug
and fast for the season, Joseph Stagg.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon so,” said the hardware dealer easily.
“Plenty of wood in the shed and a full pork barrel,”
and he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
Just then Prince whined out on the cold porch
and rattled his chain. Uncle Joe never seemed to
notice it!
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May went to bed that evening in a much
more serious mood than usual. Before going she
got a heap of old sacks from the woodshed for poor
Prince to snuggle down in.
</p>
<p>
This snow did not amount to much; it was little
more than a hoar-frost, as Mr. Stagg said. It
frosted the brown grass, but melted away in the
paths. This might be, however, the last chance for
a Sunday walk in the woods for some time, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
Carolyn May did not propose to miss it. It was the
one thing Uncle Joe did for her that the little girl
could hope was done because he loved her—“oh, a
teeny, weeny mite!”
</p>
<p>
Of course, uncles and guardians just had to take
little girls home and feed and clothe them—or else
send them to a poorhouse. Carolyn May understood
that. But going for a Sunday walk was different.
Uncle Joe’s yielding to her desire in this matter
awoke the fluttering hope in the child’s breast that
she was beloved.
</p>
<p>
On this Sunday she wished particularly to get him
off by himself. Her heart was filled with a great
purpose. She felt that they must come to an understanding.
</p>
<p>
They walked to the very glade where they had
met Miss Amanda Parlow, and Prince had killed
the blacksnake. Somehow, their steps always seemed
to turn that way. But they had never come upon
Miss Amanda in their walks a second time.
</p>
<p>
On this particular occasion Uncle Joe sat down
upon the log by the brook where Miss Amanda had
once sat. Carolyn May stood before him.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Joe,” the little girl said, her blue eyes
dark with trouble, “will you tell me something?”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon so, child, if I can,” he responded, looking
at her curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Am—am I just charity, Uncle Joe?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh? What’s that, Car’lyn May?” he exclaimed,
startled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
“Am I just a charity orphan? Didn’t my papa
leave <em>any</em> money a-<em>tall</em> for me? Did you take me
just out of charity?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” gasped the hardware dealer.
</p>
<p>
“I—I wish you’d answer me, Uncle Joe,” went
on Carolyn May with a brave effort to keep from
crying. “Isn’t there <em>any</em> money left for me—and
Princey?”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg was too blunt a person to see his
way clear to dodging the question. And he could
not speak a falsehood.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! Well, I’ll tell you, Car’lyn May. There
isn’t <em>much</em> left, and that’s a fact. It isn’t your
father’s fault. He thought there was plenty. But
a business he invested in got into bad hands, and the
little nest egg he’d laid up for his family was lost.”
</p>
<p>
“All lost, Uncle Joe?” quavered Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“All lost,” repeated the hardware merchant
firmly.
</p>
<p>
“Then—then I <em>am</em> just charity. And so’s Prince,”
whispered Carolyn May. “I—I s’pose we could
go to the poorhouse, Prince and me; but they mayn’t
like dogs there.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” ejaculated Joseph Stagg in a
sharp tone. “What’s that?” he repeated.
</p>
<p>
“I—I know you aren’t just used to children,”
went on Carolyn May, somewhat helplessly.
“You’re real nice to me, Uncle Joe; but Prince and
me—we really are a nuisance to you.”
</p>
<p>
The man stared at her for a moment in silence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
but the flush that dyed his cheeks was a flush of
shame. The very word he had used on that fateful
day when Carolyn May Cameron had come to The
Corners! He had said to himself that she would be
a nuisance.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we ought to have gone to a poorhouse
right at first,” stammered the little girl, when Mr.
Stagg broke in on her observation in a voice so
rough that she was startled.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, child! Who put such an idea into
your head?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I thought of it myself, Uncle Joe.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you like it any more here with Aunty Rose
and—and me?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! Only—only, Uncle Joe, I don’t want
to stay, if we’re a nuisance, Prince and me. I don’t
want to stay, if you don’t love me.”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg had become quite excited. He stood
up, running his fingers through his bushy hair, and
knocking off his hat.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” he finally cried once more. “How
do you know I don’t love you, Car’lyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—why—But, Uncle Joe! how do I know
you do love me?” demanded the little girl. “<em>You
never told me so!</em>”
</p>
<p>
The startled man sank upon the log again.
</p>
<p>
“Well, maybe that’s so,” he murmured. “I
s’pose it isn’t my way to be very—very—softlike.
But listen here, Car’lyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t likely to tell you very frequent how much
I—I think of you. Ahem! But you’d better stop
worrying about such things as money and the like.
What I’ve got comes pretty near belonging to you.
Anyway, unless I have to go to the poorhouse myself,
I reckon you needn’t worry about going,” and
he coughed again drily.
</p>
<p>
“As far as us loving you—Well, your Aunty
Rose loves you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know she does!” agreed Carolyn May,
nodding.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! How do you know that so well, and yet
you don’t know that I love you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—well—now,” stammered Carolyn May,
“when there isn’t anybody else around but Aunty
Rose and me, she tells me so.”
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” Mr. Stagg cleared his throat. “Well,
there isn’t anybody else around here but you and
me—and the dog,” and his eyes twinkled; “so I’ll
admit, under cross-examination, that I love you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe!” She bounded at him, sobbing
and laughing. “Is it really so? Do you?”
</p>
<p>
For the first time Joseph Stagg lifted her upon
his knee. She snuggled up against his vest and put
one little arm around his neck—as far as it would
go.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Dear</em> Uncle Joe!” she sighed ecstatically. “I
don’t mind if I <em>am</em> charity. If you love me, it takes
all the sting out. And I’ll help to make you happy,
too!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, child!” came huskily, “ain’t I happy
enough?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Uncle Joe, I don’t believe you can be
really and truly happy, when you are always worrying
about business. You don’t ever seem to have
time to <em>look up</em> and see the sky, or stop to hear the
birds sing.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me, Uncle Joe,” concluded Carolyn
May, giving a happy little jump on his lap, “that if
you let your mind sort o’ run on—on something besides
hardware once in a while, maybe you would
have time to show me how <em>much</em> you loved me.
Then I wouldn’t have to ask.”
</p>
<p>
The man looked at her somewhat blankly. Then
he turned his head, ran his hand through his bushy
hair, and gazed away meditatively.
</p>
<p>
The little girl had awakened his heart. And that
heart was very, very sore.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—A FIND IN THE DRIFTS</h2>
<p>
Before the week was over, winter had come
to Sunrise Cove and The Corners in earnest.
Snow fell and drifted, until there was scarcely
anything to be seen one morning when Carolyn May
awoke and looked out of her bedroom windows but
a white, fleecy mantle.
</p>
<p>
This was more snow than the little girl had ever
seen in New York. She came down to breakfast
very much excited.
</p>
<p>
“What are we going to do about all this snow?”
she asked. “Why! there isn’t any janitor to shovel
off the walk, and no street cleaners to clear the
crosswalks! How am I ever going to get to
school?”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you’ll get to school, all right, if the
men get through with the ploughs before half-past
eight. And if Miss Minnie gets here,” chuckled
Uncle Joe.
</p>
<p>
He went out and fed the fowls for Aunty Rose
and did the other chores. But when he started for
the store, promising to send Chet Gormley up to dig
the paths, he had to wade through drifts higher than
the top rail of the fences.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t they shovel up the snow and put
it in carts and carry it all away?” asked Carolyn
May of Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
“Who ever heard the like?” returned Mrs. Kennedy.
“What kind of a way is that to do, child?
And where would they cart it to? There’s just as
much snow in one place as there is in another.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, in New York,” explained the little girl,
“there’s always an army of men at work after a
snowstorm—poor men, you know. And lots and
lots of wagons. My papa used to say the snow was
a blessing to the poor who wanted to earn a little
money.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, lots of the men that shovel snow
don’t have warm coats—or mittens, even—or overshoes!
They wrap their feet in potato sacks to keep
them warm and dry.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” murmured Aunty Rose. “So that’s
what they do with snow in the city, is it? Live and
learn.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe had shovelled off the porch and steps,
and Prince had beaten his own dooryard in the snow
in front of his house. For he had a house of his
own, now—a roomy, warm one—built by Mr.
Parlow.
</p>
<p>
It must be confessed that, although Uncle Joe
paid for the building of this dog-house, it never
would have been built by Jedidiah Parlow had it
not been for Carolyn May. At first the grouchy old
carpenter refused to do the job.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t got to work for Joe Stagg’s money—not
yit, I guess,” growled the carpenter. “Tell him to
git somebody else to build his house.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but Mr. Parlow,” gasped Carolyn May,
quite amazed, “it isn’t for Uncle Joe, you know!”
</p>
<p>
“What ain’t for your Uncle Joe?” demanded
Mr. Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“The dog-house.”
</p>
<p>
“Why ain’t it? His money’s goin’ to pay for it,
I reckon!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, that’s so,” admitted Carolyn May.
“But Prince is going to live in it, and, you know,
Prince is a friend of yours, Mr. Parlow.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal, no gittin’ around sich logic, I do allow,”
grunted the old man, his eyes twinkling, and the flush
of anger dying out of his cheeks. “I s’pose it is fur
the dog. And the poor beast ain’t nobody’s enemy.
Wal!”
</p>
<p>
So Prince had his warm house for the winter.
Now Carolyn May put on her rubber boots and
warm coat and hood and went out to release the dog
for his morning run. His “morning scramble”
would be the better term on this occasion. Why,
at the first bound he was buried in a drift!
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it lucky,” said Carolyn May to Aunty
Rose, who stood in the doorway, “that Prince can
smell his way around so well? If it wasn’t for his
nose, he’d never be able to find his way out of those
drifts. If <em>I</em> fell down in one, I know I wouldn’t be
able to smell my way out again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
But after Chet Gormley had come and dug the
paths, and the ox-teams had come along with ploughs
to break out the roads, she found it possible to go
to school. She took Prince with her.
</p>
<p>
Prince had learned to behave very well at school
now. He was not allowed in the schoolroom, but
he remained on the porch or went back home, as he
pleased. But he was always waiting at the door for
his little mistress at recess and when the session
closed.
</p>
<p>
At noon Uncle Joe came home, dragging a sled—a
big roomy one, glistening with red paint. Just the
nicest sled Carolyn May had ever seen, and one of
the best the hardware dealer carried in stock.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my, that’s lovely!” breathed the little girl
in awed delight. “That’s ever so much better than
any sled I ever had before. And Prince could draw
me on it, if I only had a harness for him. He used
to drag me in the park. Of course, if he saw a cat,
I had to get off and hold him.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg, once started upon the path of good
deeds, seemed to like it. At night he brought home
certain straps and rivets, and in the kitchen, much to
Aunty Rose’s amazement, he fitted Prince to a harness
which the next day Carolyn May used on the
dog, and Prince drew her very nicely along the
beaten paths.
</p>
<p>
“But, if anybody would have told me, I’m free
to confess I would not have believed it,” Aunty
Rose declared, referring to Mr. Stagg’s actions in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
stronger language than Carolyn May had ever heard
her use before.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May made a practice now of kissing
Uncle Joe good-night when he started for the store
after supper. “’Cause I’m always in bed when you
get home,” she explained.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose appeared not to notice this display
of affection, and after a time Mr. Stagg got so used
to it that he positively did not blush. But she climbed
right into his lap and kissed him for the harness and
sled, and the housekeeper felt in duty bound to comment
upon it.
</p>
<p>
“You’re on the road to spoil that child, Joseph
Stagg,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Ahem!” coughed the hardware dealer, eyeing
her with more boldness than he was usually able to
display. “Ahem! I reckon somebody else around
here began the spoiling—if any—Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
And the woman smiled grimly. “Well,” she said,
“<em>you</em> should not be in your second childhood—at
your age.”
</p>
<p>
By Saturday the roads were in splendid condition
for sleighing. The heavy sleds, transporting timber
or sawed planks from the camps and mills to town,
packed the snow firmly.
</p>
<p>
So Carolyn May went sledding. Soberly, Prince
drew the new red sled and his little mistress along
the road towards Miss Amanda’s. Of late the little
girl wanted to see the carpenter’s daughter just as
frequently as possible. There was a secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
understanding between Miss Parlow and Carolyn May—something
both thought of continually, but of which
neither spoke directly.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May knew that the pretty lady was glad
that Uncle Joe had come to love her. Every mark
of affection that the hardware merchant showed his
little niece the latter retailed to Miss Amanda, and
each event lost nothing in the telling.
</p>
<p>
Now she desired to show her friend the new sled
and Prince’s harness. Mr. Stagg might still pass
the Parlow house with his face averted; nevertheless,
his praises were sung to Miss Amanda continually
by Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Prince,” said the little girl as they set
forth, “I do hope we don’t meet any cats—or other
dogs, either. Dogs are bad enough; but, you know,
if you see a cat you can<em>not</em> keep your mind on what
you are doing.”
</p>
<p>
Prince whined and wagged his ridiculous tail. It
did seem as though he knew just what she was talking
about.
</p>
<p>
However, until they got away from The Corners,
at least, they met with no adventure. The blacksmith
hailed Carolyn May—he was a jolly fellow—and
asked her if she wanted to have her horse
sharpened.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you, Mr. Lardner,” the little girl
replied. “You see, Prince has got his claws, so he
<em>can’t</em> slip on the hard snow. He doesn’t need to be
sharpened like the horses.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not altogether a pleasant afternoon, for
there was a curtain of haze being drawn over the
sun, and the wind was searching. And not only did
the wind cut sharply, but it blew clouds of light snow
from the tops of the drifts into one’s face and eyes.
Carolyn May almost wished she had not started for
Miss Amanda’s house—and this before she was halfway
to her destination.
</p>
<p>
Prince, however, did not seem to mind it much.
The sled slipped easily over the beaten snow, and
Carolyn May was a light load for him, for Prince
was a strong dog.
</p>
<p>
Out of sight of the houses grouped at The Corners
the road to town seemed as lonely as though it
were a veritable wilderness. Here and there the
drifts had piled six feet deep, for the wind had a
free sweep across the barrens.
</p>
<p>
“Now, there’s somebody coming,” said Carolyn
May, seeing a moving object ahead between the
clouds of drifting snow spray. “Is it a sleigh,
Princey, or just a man?”
</p>
<p>
She lost sight of the object, then sighted it again.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a man. It can’t be a bear, Princey.”
Everybody had told her there were no more bears
left in the woods about Sunrise Cove.
</p>
<p>
“And, anyway, I’m only afraid of bears at night—when
I go up to bed in the dark,” Carolyn May
told herself. “Here it is broad daylight!”
</p>
<p>
Besides, if it were any such animal, Prince would
surely give tongue. He only sniffed and pricked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
his ears. The strange object had disappeared again.
</p>
<p>
It was just at the place where the spring spouted
out of the rocky hillside and trickled across the road.
There was a sort of natural watering trough here
in the rock where the horses stopped to drink. The
dog drew the little girl closer to the spot.
</p>
<p>
“Where <em>has</em> that man gone to? If it was a man.”
</p>
<p>
Prince stopped suddenly and whined.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter, Princey?” demanded Carolyn
May, really quite disturbed. There was something
in the drift that the wind was heaping beside
the beaten track. What could it be? “Prince!”
</p>
<p>
The dog barked, and then looked around at his
mistress, as though to say: “See there!”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May tumbled off the sled in a hurry.
When she did so she slipped on a patch of snow-covered
ice and fell. But she was not hurt.
</p>
<p>
“There! that’s where the water runs across the
road. It’s all slippy—Oh!”
</p>
<p>
It was the sleeve of a man’s rough coat thrust out
of the snowbank that brought this last cry to the
child’s lips. In a very few moments the sign of the
unfortunate wayfarer would have been completely
covered in the drifting snow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh! It’s a man!” burst from Carolyn
May’s trembling lips. “How cold he must be!”
</p>
<p>
She was cold herself—and frightened. She had
heard of people dying in the snow; and this person
seemed perfectly helpless.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, Prince!” she cried, recovering a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
measure of her courage. “We can’t let him die
here! We’ve just <em>got</em> to save him!”
</p>
<p>
She plumped down on her knees and began brushing
the snow away. She uncovered his shoulder.
She took hold of this with her mittened hands and
tried to shake the prone figure.
</p>
<p>
He moved. It was ever so little, but it inspired
Carolyn May with hope. She was not so much
afraid of him now, she told herself. He was not
dead.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do wake up! Please wake up!” she cried,
digging away the snow as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
A shaggy head was revealed, with an old cap
pulled down tightly over the ears. The man moved
again and grunted something. He half turned over,
and there was blood upon the snow, and a great
frosted cake of it on the side of his face.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was dreadfully frightened. The
man’s head was cut and the blood was smeared over
the front of his jacket. Now she could see a puddle
of it, right where he had fallen on the ice—just as
she had fallen herself. Only, he had struck his head
on a rock and cut himself.
</p>
<p>
“You poor thing!” murmured Carolyn May.
“Oh, you mustn’t lie here! You must get up!
You’ll—you’ll be frozen!”
</p>
<p>
“Easy, mate,” muttered the man. “I ain’t jest
right in my top-hamper, I reckon. Hold hard,
matey.”
</p>
<p>
He tried to get up. He rose to his knees, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
pitched forward again. Carolyn May was not afraid
of him now—only troubled.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take you to Miss Amanda,” cried the little
girl, pulling at his coat again. “She’s a nurse, and
she’ll know just what to do for you. Come, Prince
and I will take you.”
</p>
<p>
The dog stood by whining, acting as though he
knew just what the trouble was and was anxious to
help. The man struggled up into a kneeling posture.
</p>
<p>
“My top-hamper ain’t jest right,” he murmured
again. “That was a crack! Blood! I reckon I’m
some hurt, miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I should say you were hurt!” Carolyn
May responded briskly. “But I know Miss Mandy
can fix you up. Let’s go there—<em>now</em>! It’s awfully
cold standing here.”
</p>
<p>
“Belike I can’t get there,” mumbled the man, still
on his knees.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you must! It’s not far. You were coming
towards The Corners, weren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“I was bound out o’ town; yes, miss,” the man
replied.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Amanda’s is the last house you passed,
then. It isn’t far,” repeated Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t believe I kin make it, matey,” groaned
the man, evidently not quite clear in his mind whom
he was addressing. He weaved to and fro as he
knelt, his eyes half-closed, muttering and groaning to
himself.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you mustn’t!” cried Carolyn May. “You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
mustn’t give up. Crawl onto my sled. Prince and I
can drag you to Miss Amanda’s. Of course, we
can.”
</p>
<p>
“Believe you’d better leave me here, matey,”
muttered the man.
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May would not hear to that. She
bustled about, brought the sled closer to him, and
made Prince stand around properly in his harness.
Then she guided the half-blinded man to the sled, on
which he managed to drop himself.
</p>
<p>
“But that dog can’t never pull me, matey,” he
declared faintly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, he can,” said Carolyn May cheerfully.
“I can help, too. When you <em>have</em> to do a thing, my
Aunty Rose says, you just up and do it. Now,
Princey—<em>pull</em>!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—THE OLD SAILOR</h2>
<p>
Aunty Rose’s philosophy must have been
correct. Prince pulled, and Carolyn May
pulled, and together they got the sled, with the
old sailor upon it, to the Parlow carpenter shop.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow slid back the front door of his shop
to stare in wonder at the group.
</p>
<p>
“For the great land of Jehoshaphat!” he
croaked. “Car’lyn May! what you got there?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Parlow, do come and help us—quick!”
gasped the little girl. “My friend has had a dreadful
bad fall.”
</p>
<p>
“Your friend?” repeated the carpenter. “I
declare, it’s that tramp that went by here just now!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, sir! he isn’t a tramp,” declared Carolyn
May firmly.
</p>
<p>
“Why ain’t he, I sh’d like to know?” grumbled
Mr. Parlow, coming gingerly forward.
</p>
<p>
“Why, if he were, Prince wouldn’t have anything
to do with him,” was the little girl’s assured reply.
“This gentleman is hurt, Mr. Parlow.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow made a clucking noise in his throat
when he saw the blood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“Guess you’re right, Car’lyn May,” he admitted.
“Call Mandy. She must see this.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda’s attention had already been attracted
to the strange arrival. She ran out and
helped her father raise the injured man from the
sled. Together they led him into the cottage.
</p>
<p>
He was not at all a bad-looking man, although his
clothing was rough and coarse. His hands were big
and square, with blunt fingers, and the fingers were
half-crooked, or half-closed, all the time. Afterwards
Carolyn May learned this was because the
old man was a sailor and had pulled on ropes so
many years.
</p>
<p>
The trained nurse and her father helped the man
to the couch, after removing his pilot coat. Miss
Amanda brought warm water and bathed the wound,
removing the congealed blood from his face and
neck.
</p>
<p>
“I think there should be a stitch or two taken in
this,” she said, “but Dr. Nugent is a long way off.
I can dress it all right and bind it up. But if it was
sewed, the wound would not leave so bad a scar.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s no matter—no matter at all, matey,” the
man hastened to say. “I’ve no money for them
doctors.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” coughed Mr. Parlow. “It’s not a matter
of dollars—Well, Mandy, if you think you can
fix him up all right——”
</p>
<p>
The nurse was ready with lint and bandages and
a dark, pleasant-smelling balsam in a bottle. Carolyn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
May, who had untackled Prince on the porch,
stood by, and watched Miss Amanda’s skilful fingers
in wonder.
</p>
<p>
The old sailor did not even groan, so the child had
no idea that the drops of perspiration that gathered
on his brow, and which Miss Amanda finally wiped
away so tenderly, were called into being by acute
suffering.
</p>
<p>
When the last bandage was adjusted and the injured
man’s eyes were closed, Mr. Parlow offered
him a wine-glass of a home-made cordial. The sailor
gulped it down, and the colour began to return to
his cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Where was you goin’, anyway?” demanded the
carpenter. “This ain’t no good day to be travellin’
in. I don’t see what that child was a-thinkin’ on, to
be out playin’ in such weather.”
</p>
<p>
“Lucky for me she was out,” said the sailor, more
vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Ya-as, I reckon that’s so,” admitted Mr. Parlow.
“But, where was you goin’?”
</p>
<p>
“Lookin’ for a job, mate,” said the sailor.
“There’s them in town that tells me I’d find work
at Adams’ camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! didn’t tell you ’twas ten mile away from
here, did they?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it? Well, no, they didn’t tell me that,”
admitted the visitor, “or I’d not started so late.
You see, I come up on a schooner. This here lake
boatin’ ain’t in my line. I’m deep-water, I am.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“So I should s’pose,” said Mr. Parlow. “How’d
you git up here, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
“The war,” said the visitor. “The war done it.
Couldn’t git a good berth in any deep-water bottom.
So I thought I’d try fresh-water sailin’. And now
they tell me this here lake’ll be froze up solid and
all the traffic stopped all winter long.”
</p>
<p>
“Likely to be,” admitted Mr. Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t it beat all?” murmured the sailor. “And
me up in this cold country—and full of rheumatiz. I
tell you, matey, I been workin’ as quartermaster’s
mate on the old Cross and Crescent Line, a-scootin’
’cross to Naples from N’York—there and back—goin’
on ten year. I ain’t goin’ to like it up here in
this here cold, northern, snowbound country, I don’t
believe.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you leave your boat for?” asked the
carpenter curiously.
</p>
<p>
“What boat? This here lake schooner? I told
you.”
</p>
<p>
“No. The other.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she was sunk. There’s things happenin’
over to the other side of the ocean, mate,” said the
injured man earnestly, “that you wouldn’t believe—no,
sir! The Cross and Crescent Line’s give up
business till after the war’s over, I reckon.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better not encourage him to talk any
more, father,” interposed Miss Amanda, coming
into the room again. “The best thing he can do
for himself is to sleep for a while.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“Thank ye, ma’am,” said the sailor humbly. “I’ll
try.”
</p>
<p>
The carpenter went back to work. Miss Amanda
took Carolyn May out into the kitchen. She looked
at her rather curiously, and once she seemed about
to speak seriously—perhaps about the injured sailor.
Carolyn May sidetracked this, however, by asking:
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think Prince is a very brave dog,
Miss Amanda? You know, he’s almost like those
Saint Bernard dogs that live in the Yalps and carry
blankets and cunning little barrels around their necks
to folks that get lost in the snow. You have seen
pictures of ’em, haven’t you, Miss Amanda?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my dear,” agreed the pretty nurse, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Only I never knew what the barrels were for,”
admitted Carolyn May. “Now, if the dogs found
the poor men in the water, drownding, maybe the
barrels would float and help keep ’em from sinking.”
</p>
<p>
“I hardly think it probable that the barrels were
for that purpose,” said Miss Amanda, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway,” urged Carolyn May, “Prince is just
as brave as those other dogs.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, yes,” agreed the woman. “And I think
that a certain little girl is very brave, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I couldn’t have got the poor gentleman
here, if it hadn’t been for Prince.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite true. And he deserves a reward for that.
We’ll call him in and give him a party,” said Miss
Amanda. “I have been saving some chicken bones
for him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear!” cried Carolyn May, “he just
adores chicken bones. You are the very kindest
lady, Miss Amanda! I love you, heaps and heaps—and
so does Prince.”
</p>
<p>
Darkness came on apace. The sky had become
overcast, and there was promise of a stormy night—more
snow, perhaps. But Miss Amanda would not
allow Carolyn May and Prince to start for home at
once.
</p>
<p>
“Watch for your uncle, Carolyn May, out of the
front-room window, and be all ready to go with
him when he comes along,” said Miss Parlow.
“No, it isn’t time for him yet. When the clock says
ten minutes to five you can begin to look for him.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! Miss Amanda,” said Carolyn May
wonderingly, “how well you know his time for coming
home, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda blushed and did not appear to think
that question needed an answer. After that she
seemed much preoccupied in mind.
</p>
<p>
When Uncle Joe came along, Carolyn May ran
out and hailed him from the porch.
</p>
<p>
“Wait for me, Uncle Joe! Wait for me and
Princey, please! Just let me get my mittens and
Prince’s harness and kiss Miss Mandy.”
</p>
<p>
That last she did most soundly, and in full view
of the man waiting in the white road. Miss
Amanda’s tenderness, as she knelt on the porch to
button Carolyn May’s coat, was marked by the hardware
dealer—and also her shining brown hair and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
her eyes so bright and sparkling. But he made no
comment on this picture when his little niece joined
him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe, I’ve got just the wonderfulest
story to tell you! Shall we harness Prince up again,
or will you——”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t wait for the dog, Car’lyn May. I’m in
a hurry. You oughtn’t to be out in this wind, either.
Get aboard your sled, now, and I’ll drag you myself,”
Mr. Stagg interrupted.
</p>
<p>
She obeyed him gaily. When he started off, she
turned to wave her mittened hand to Miss Amanda,
who still stood on the porch. But the door of the
carpenter shop, where a lamp burned, was shut
tightly.
</p>
<p>
“That woman will get her death of cold,” grumbled
Uncle Joe, starting off at a round pace. “Don’t
know enough to go in out o’ the cold.”
</p>
<p>
But Amanda Parlow did not notice the cold. She
was thinking of a time, oh, so long ago! when Joe
Stagg had seated her on his bright red sled and given
her a ride. How her heart had beat when he had
turned to gaze at her! And now—Slowly her
eyes filled with tears, and again:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe! Joe! How could you?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—A SALT-SEA FLAVOUR</h2>
<p>
Swiftly Joseph Stagg trudged towards home,
dragging Carolyn May behind him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed the little girl
with exultation, “we’re all so excited, Uncle Joe!”
</p>
<p>
“I can see you’re all of a-twitter,” he returned
absent-mindedly. “What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you never could guess!” was Carolyn May’s
introduction, and forthwith, in breathless sentences,
went on to tell of her discovery in the snow and
about the old sailor now lying asleep on the Parlow
couch.
</p>
<p>
“I vum!” ejaculated Uncle Joe, when he had
listened to it all. “Who ever heard the beat of that!
And Jed Parlow really helped take him in, did he?
The day of miracles isn’t past, then, that’s sure.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, when Carolyn May arrived at home,
the story had to be told all over again to Aunty Rose
Kennedy—all the details, even to Prince’s feast of
chicken bones. If the housekeeper was surprised—as
Joseph Stagg had been—that the carpenter should
take the injured man into his house, she did not
say so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“A mighty plucky youngster, this Car’lyn May of
ours,” Uncle Joe remarked. “What do you say,
Aunty Rose?”
</p>
<p>
“She is, indeed, Joseph Stagg,” agreed the
woman.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was very much excited over the adventure,
and, although it snowed some that night
and the paths were drifted full in places, she wanted
greatly to go down to the Parlow house the next day
to see her “sailor man,” as she called the unfortunate
she had assisted.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, she could not expect Uncle Joe to stop
and ask how the sailor was, he not being on speaking
terms with the Parlows; but the hardware dealer
did pick up a morsel of news about the stranger and
brought it home at noon time to detail to Aunty Rose
and the little girl at the dinner table.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you,” Mr. Stagg maintained, “Jed Parlow’s
had a change of heart, or something. Know
what he’s done?”
</p>
<p>
“I could not guess, Joseph Stagg,” said Aunty
Rose austerely.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he’s letting that old tramp Car’lyn May
picked up stay there till he gets well enough to work,
so they tell me. Who ever heard the like? And
Jed hasn’t a blessed thing for a man like that tramp
to do at this time of year.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Miss Amanda that lets him stay, I guess,”
said Carolyn May with a wise little nod of her sunny
head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hum!” grunted her uncle. “Time was when
Jed Parlow wouldn’t have played the part of a good
Samaritan to the Angel Gabriel himself.”
</p>
<p>
“You should not say such things in the hearing
of the child,” admonished Aunty Rose severely.
“Perhaps Jedidiah Parlow has been misjudged all
these years. He may have a kinder heart than you
think.”
</p>
<p>
“Kind-hearted!” snorted Mr. Stagg. “If he’s
got a heart at all, he’s successfully hidden it for nigh
seventy years, from all I’ve heard tell.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe, he <em>must</em> have a heart, you know,”
broke in Carolyn May earnestly. “We had physerology
studies in the school I used to go to, and you
have to have hearts, and lungs, and livers, and other
inwards, or else you couldn’t keep going. Mr. Parlow
must have a heart.”
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose he must,” acknowledged Uncle Joe,
“from that standpoint. But, beside from its pumping
blood through his arteries, his heart action hasn’t
been what you might call excessive. And for him to
take that old codger in out o’ the snow——”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose interrupted, as she often did at such
times, sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Joseph Stagg, for a man with ordinary, good
common sense, as you’ve got, you do sometimes ’pear
to be pretty near purblind. I shouldn’t wonder if
Jedidiah Parlow has changed of late. It is more
than probable.”
</p>
<p>
Then, as Mr. Stagg continued to stare at her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
plainly surprised by her vehemence, the housekeeper
continued:
</p>
<p>
“Nor is he the only person that shows signs of
change—and from the same cause. Have you never
stopped to think of other changes nearer home that
have been brought about by the same means? Answer
me, Joseph Stagg.”
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer cast a quick glance at Carolyn
May, busy with her knife and fork, and had the
grace to blush a little. Then, suddenly, his eyes
twinkled, and a smile wreathed the corners of his
mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on, Aunty Rose. I say! do you ever look
in the mirror?”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind about me, Joseph Stagg,” she rejoined
rather tartly. “Never mind about me!”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May insisted on going to the Parlow
house herself after school that afternoon to enquire
about her “sailor man.” She just had to know personally
how he was getting on!
</p>
<p>
The steady stream of timber sleds from Adams’
camp, and others, had beaten down the drifts again,
so Aunty Rose made no objection to the little girl
and the dog’s making this call.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow peered at them through the window
of the carpenter’s shop and waved his hand; but
Carolyn May went right into the house. When she
had been kissed by Miss Amanda, and Prince had
lain down by the kitchen range, the little girl demanded:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“And do tell me how my sailor man is, Miss
Mandy. He got <em>such</em> a bump on the head!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the man’s wound is really serious. I’m
keeping him in bed. But you can go up to see him.
He’s talked a lot about you, Carolyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” eagerly cried the little girl. “And
I’m just as cur’ous about him as I can be.”
</p>
<p>
“Why are you so curious about him?” asked
Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“Because he’s a sailor and has been away across
the ocean—right to the place my papa and mamma
were going to when the <em>Dunraven</em> was sunk. Don’t
you see? They were going to Naples. That’s in
Italy. And this sailor man told Mr. Parlow, Miss
Amanda, that he has been to Naples. So he must
have been through that Mediterranean Ocean, or
sea, or whatever it is—right where my papa and
mamma were lost.”
</p>
<p>
The sailor lay in the warm bedroom over the
kitchen. In bed, with his head bound up as though
it were in a huge nightcap, he looked oddly like a
gnome, for he was banked up with pillows, and wore
one of Mr. Parlow’s flannelette nightshirts, which
was too small for him. In spite of his odd habiliments,
his was a cheerful face—red, with few
wrinkles, save about his eyes, and a scattering brush
of grey bristles along his jaw, for he needed a
shave.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, my hearties!” was his rumbling greeting
when Carolyn May and Miss Amanda appeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“This is the little miss I’ve got to thank for savin’
me yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
“And my dog, sir,” said Carolyn May. “He’s
downstairs by the stove. Of course, I couldn’t have
brought you here on my sled, if it hadn’t been for
Princey.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a fine dog,” agreed the sailor. “I ain’t
never seen a finer.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May warmed to him more and more at
this enthusiastic praise. She prattled on gaily and
soon had her “sailor man” telling all about the sea
and ships, and “they that go down therein.”
</p>
<p>
“For, you see,” explained Carolyn May, “I’m
dreadful cur’ous about the sea. My papa and
mamma were lost at sea.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say so, little miss!” exclaimed the
old fellow. “Aye, aye, that’s too bad.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda had disappeared, busy about some
household matter, and the little girl and the sailor
were alone together.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Carolyn May proceeded, “it is dreadful
hard to <em>feel</em> that it is so.”
</p>
<p>
“Feel that what’s so, little miss?” asked the man
in bed.
</p>
<p>
“That my papa and mamma are really
drownd-ed,” said the little girl with quivering lips.
“Some of the folks on their boat were saved. The
papers said so.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye!” exclaimed the sailor, his brows puckered
into a frown. “Aye, aye, matey! that’s allus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
the way. Why, I was saved myself from a wreck.
I was in the first officer’s boat, and we in that boat
was saved. There was another boat—the purser’s,
it was—was driftin’ about all night with us. We
come one time near smashin’ into each other and
wreckin’ both boats. There was a heavy swell on.
</p>
<p>
“Yet,” pursued the sailor, “come daylight, and
the fog splitting we never could find the purser’s
boat. She had jest as good a chance as us after the
steamship sank. But there it was! We got separated
from her, and we was saved, whilst the purser’s
boat wasn’t never heard on again.”
</p>
<p>
“That was dreadful!” sighed the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, little miss. And the poor passengers!
Purser had twenty or more in his boat. Women
mostly. But there was a sick man, too. Why, I
helped lower his wife and him into the boat ’fore I
was called to go with the first officer in his boat.
We was the last to cast off. The purser had jest as
good a chance as we did.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I won’t never forgit that time, little
miss,” went on the seaman, seeing the blue eyes fixed
on his face, round with interest. “No! And I’ve
seen some tough times, too.
</p>
<p>
“The ship was riddled. She had to sink—and it
was night. We burned Coston lights, and our signal
gun banged away for help, and the old siren tooted.
The wireless top-hamper had been shot away in the
fust place.
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t have no chance at all to save the ship.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
Some of the boats was smashed. Two was overturned
jest as they struck the water. There wasn’t
any of the life rafts launched at all. But we didn’t
have much of a panic; the steerage passengers was
jest like dumb cattle.
</p>
<p>
“They was goin’ back to Italy because of the
war—the men to fight, the women and children so’s
to benefit by the Government pay to soldiers’
families.”
</p>
<p>
This was mostly beyond Carolyn May’s comprehension,
but she listened to the sailor with serious attention.
The seaman told his story as though it
really were unforgettable.
</p>
<p>
“There was the sick man I told you about, little
miss. He was a wonder, that feller! Cheerful—brave—Don’t
often see a feller like him. Jokin’
to the last, he was. He didn’t want to go in the
purser’s boat, if there was more women or children
to go.
</p>
<p>
“We told him all the women folk had left the
ship. So, then, he let me lower him down into the
purser’s boat after his wife. And that boat had as
good a chance as we had, I tell you,” repeated the
seaman in quite an excited manner.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed Carolyn May. “My
papa and mamma might have been just like that,”
she added. “Of course, we don’t know whether
they got off the steamship at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye!” the sailor said. “Pretty tough on
you, little miss.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda had come back into the room, and
she stood listening to the old man’s talk. She said:
</p>
<p>
“Carolyn May, I think you had better go downstairs
now. We mustn’t let our patient talk too
much. It won’t be good for him.”
</p>
<p>
So Carolyn May shook hands with the old sailor
and started downstairs ahead of Miss Amanda.
The latter lingered a moment to ask a question.
</p>
<p>
“What was the name of the steamship you were
wrecked on?” she asked. “The one you were just
telling about.”
</p>
<p>
“She was the <em>Dunraven</em>—the <em>Dunraven</em>, of the
Cross and Crescent Line,” replied the mariner.
“Didn’t I tell you that before, ma’am?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—WILL WONDERS NEVER CEASE?</h2>
<p>
Again it snowed all night.
“My goodness me!” sighed Carolyn May
the next morning when she arose, to find all
the paths filled up again. “Don’t it <em>ever</em> stop snowing
till springtime comes around again, Aunty
Rose?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” answered the housekeeper, smiling
quietly. “But I thought you loved the snow?”
</p>
<p>
“I do,” the child responded. “Anyway, I guess
I do,” she added. “But—but couldn’t they spread
it out a little thinner? Seems to me we must be getting
it all at once. Why, I can’t see any of the walls
or fences!”
</p>
<p>
That was true enough. Uncle Joe had even to dig
Prince out of his house that morning. After that,
when it stormed, Prince was allowed to lie by the
kitchen fire—certainly a great concession on Aunty
Rose’s part.
</p>
<p>
This was really the heaviest storm of the season,
so far. When Carolyn May floundered to school,
with Prince going in front to break the path, there
was a huge bank of snow piled against one corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
of the schoolhouse. This quite closed up the boys’
door, and only the girls’ entrance could be used.
</p>
<p>
But the boys got to work at recess and tunnelled
through the great drift, so that there was a passage
to their door. The wind had packed the snow hard,
and the crust had frozen, so there was a safe roof
over the tunnel through the snow.
</p>
<p>
At noon some of the girls went through the passage,
too; and among them was Carolyn May. As
she went down the steps she laughed gleefully,
crying:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s like going into the subway, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the subway?” asked Freda Payne instantly.
“You don’t mean to say you have snow
tunnels like this in the city, do you? You said men
carted the snow all away in wagons, or melted it.
Can’t be much snow where you come from, Car’lyn
May.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; not snow tunnels,” the city child explained.
She had to do a good deal of explaining
these days. “The subway’s just a hole in the
ground, and you go down steps into it, and it’s all—all
marble, I guess, ’cause it’s white and shiny. And
trains come along, and you get on, and you ride all
the way from One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street
down to papa’s office, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Car’lyn May Cam’ron!” shrieked Freda.
</p>
<p>
“Trains under the ground?” demanded another
of her schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said the little city girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“Trains of <em>cars</em>? Like our trains up here?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye-es,” said Carolyn May slowly, feeling that
her tale was disbelieved.
</p>
<p>
“My mercy!” declared the black-eyed girl.
“That’s the biggest story you’ve told us yet. I’m
going to tell my mamma about that. She says you’ve
got such a ’magination. But I know <em>this</em> is just plain
fib, and nothing else—so there!”
</p>
<p>
It hurt Carolyn May sorely to have her word
doubted. She had begun to shrink from telling her
little friends about any of the wonders which had
been such commonplace matters to her when she had
lived in New York. They simply could not believe
the things the city child said were so.
</p>
<p>
It was on this very day, and at noon time, when
Mr. Stagg was returning to the store, that a most
astounding thing happened.
</p>
<p>
Had Mrs. Gormley seen it, that good woman
would have had such a measure of gossip to relate
as she had not enjoyed for a long time. It was,
indeed, a most amazing occurrence.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg was walking briskly towards Sunrise
Cove in his big felt snow-boots, such as all men wore
in that locality, and was abreast of the Parlow shop
and cottage—which he always sought to avoid looking
at—when he heard a door open and close.
</p>
<p>
He tried not to look that way. But his ear told
him instantly that the person who had come out was
Miss Amanda, rather than her father. Knowing
this, how could he help darting a glance at her?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
For more years than he cared to count, Joseph
Stagg had been passing back and forth along this
road. Sometimes, in his secret heart, he wished the
Parlow place would burn down, or be otherwise
swept from its site. It was an abomination to him.
Yet he was always tempted to steal a glance as he
passed, in hope of seeing Miss Amanda. He often
saw Mr. Parlow staring from his shop at him, his
grey old face puckered into a scowl, but the carpenter’s
daughter was seldom in evidence when Mr.
Stagg went by. She might be, at such times, behind
the front-room blinds peering out at him; but he did
not know that.
</p>
<p>
It had not always been so. As Chet Gormley’s
gossipy mother had told Carolyn May, time was
when the hardware dealer—then having just opened
his store in Sunrise Cove—and the carpenter’s
daughter were frequently together.
</p>
<p>
Often when Joseph Stagg came in sight of the
Parlow residence Amanda was at the gate. She
sometimes walked to town with him. He even remembered—but
that was still earlier in their lives—pulling
her on his red sled. There had never been
any other girl Joe Stagg cared for. And now——
</p>
<p>
He ventured another quick glance towards the
Parlow side of the road. Miss Amanda stood on the
porch, looking directly at him.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Stagg,” she called earnestly, “I must speak
to you.”
</p>
<p>
Save on the Sunday when Prince had killed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
blacksnake, Miss Amanda had not spoken directly
to the hardware merchant in all these hungry years.
It rather shocked Joseph Stagg now that she should
do so.
</p>
<p>
“Will you come in?” she urged him, her voice
rather tremulous.
</p>
<p>
There was a moment of absolute silence.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me! Yes!” ejaculated the hardware man
finally.
</p>
<p>
He turned in at the path to the gate, opened the
latter, and reached the porch. He was quite himself
when he arrived before her.
</p>
<p>
“I assure you, Mr. Stagg,” Miss Amanda said
hurriedly, “it is no personal matter that causes me
to stop you in this fashion.”
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am?” responded the man stiffly.
</p>
<p>
He was looking directly at her now, and it was
Miss Amanda who could not bring her gaze to meet
his. Her face had first flushed, and now was pale.
The long lashes, lowered over her brown eyes, curled
against her smooth cheek. Like Carolyn May, Mr.
Stagg thought her a very lovely lady, indeed.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to come in and speak with this sailor
who was hurt,” she finally said. “Carolyn May
has told you about him, hasn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
“The whole neighbourhood has been talking
about it,” returned Joseph Stagg grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I suppose so,” Miss Amanda said hastily.
“There is something he can tell you, Mr. Stagg, that
I think you should know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
To say that he was puzzled would be putting it
mildly. Mr. Stagg felt as though he were in a
dream as he followed Miss Amanda indoors. And
he expected an awakening at any moment.
</p>
<p>
“My father has gone into town, Mr. Stagg,”
explained Miss Amanda, leading the way through
the hall, or “entry,” into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
The cheerful little kitchen, full of light and
warmth, was very attractive to Mr. Stagg. He had
not been in it for a long time. The big rocking-chair
by the window, in which Miss Amanda’s mother had
for several years before her death spent her waking
hours, was now occupied by the sailor. His head
was still swathed in bandages, but his grey eyes were
keen, and he nodded briskly to the storekeeper.
</p>
<p>
“This is the little girl’s uncle, Benjamin,” Miss
Amanda said quietly. “He will be interested in
what you have already told me about the loss of the
<em>Dunraven</em>. Will you please repeat it all?”
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Dunraven</em>?” gasped Mr. Stagg, sitting
down without being asked. “Hannah——”
</p>
<p>
“There is no hope, of course,” Amanda Parlow
spoke up quickly, “that your sister, Mr. Stagg, and
her husband were not lost. But having found out
that Benjamin was on that steamer with them, I
thought you should know. I have warned him to be
careful how he speaks before Carolyn May. You
may wish to hear the story at first hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” choked Joseph Stagg. He wanted
to say more, but could not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
Benjamin Hardy’s watery eyes blinked, and he
blew his nose.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, mate!” he rumbled, “hard lines—for
a fact. I give my tes-ti-mony ’fore the consul
when we was landed—so did all that was left of us
from the <em>Dunraven</em>. Me bein’ an unlettered man,
they didn’t run me very clos’t. I can’t add much
more to it.
</p>
<p>
“As I say, that purser’s boat your sister and her
sickly husband was in had jest as good a chance as
we had. We nigh bumped into each other soon after
the <em>Dunraven</em> sunk. So, then, we pulled off aways
from each other. Then the fog rolled up from the
African shore—a heap o’ fog, mate. It sponged out
the lamp in the purser’s boat. We never seen no
more of ’em—nor heard no more.”
</p>
<p>
He went on with other particulars, but all, so Mr.
Stagg thought, futile and pointless. He knew the
steamship, <em>Dunraven</em>, had sunk; and what mattered
it whether Hannah and her husband had gone down
with her or gone down with the purser’s boat a few
hours later? In his agony of spirit, he said something
like this—and rather brusquely—to the old
seaman.
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye,” admitted Benjamin Hardy.
“’Twould seem so to a landsman. But there is
many a wonder of the sea that landsmen don’t know
about, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell Mr. Stagg about the fog and the current,
Benjamin,” urged Miss Amanda.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg looked across the room at Miss
Amanda, but he listened to the sailor. Benjamin
Hardy had plainly thought much about the incidents
surrounding the loss of the <em>Dunraven</em>. Perhaps, as
time passed, and he saw those incidents in better perspective,
his wondering about them had evolved
theories. Whether these theories were to be accepted
without suspicion was another matter.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg was not a credulous man. Indeed,
he was, in a business sense, suspicious. Mr. Parlow
had said that Joe Stagg bit every quarter he took in
over his counter to find out whether it was lead or
silver!
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer listened now to the sailor’s
rather wandering tale with more patience than interest.
Indeed, it was as much out of politeness to
Miss Amanda as anything that kept him from interrupting.
</p>
<p>
“It was the current confused us. The purser had
a sea anchor out,” said Benjamin Hardy. “Something
like a drag, mister. Kept his boat from
driftin’. And that’s how us in the first officer’s boat
come nigh smashin’ into him. There’s a strong set
of the current towards the African coast in them
parts.
</p>
<p>
“Well, sir, after the two boats come so nigh
smashin’ into each other, the purser must have
slipped his drag. Anyway, the fog come up thick
from the south and hid their lights from us. We
never heard no cry, nor nothin’. Then, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
day-break, the French battleships that had stood by
picked us up, but we couldn’t find the purser’s boat.
</p>
<p>
“The fog still lay as thick as a blanket to the
so’th’ard—how thick and how far we didn’t know.
And the Frenchman, I reckon, was afraid it might
hide more of the enemy, and she was crippled. No,
sir, if the purser’s boat had drifted off that way—and
the set of the tide was that way, I know—we
couldn’t have seen nor heard her if she was more’n
a mile off.”
</p>
<p>
“And were Hannah—were my sister and her husband
in that boat?” queried Mr. Stagg thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure, by the details Benjamin has given
me,” said Miss Amanda softly, “that your sister
and Mr. Cameron were two of its passengers.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a long time ago, now,” said the hardware
dealer. “Surely, if they had been picked up
or had reached the coast of Africa, we would have
heard about it.”
</p>
<p>
“It would seem so,” the woman agreed gently.
</p>
<p>
“You never know what may happen at sea, mister,
till it happens,” Benjamin Hardy declared. “What
became of that boat——”
</p>
<p>
He seemed to stick to that idea. But the possibility
of the small boat’s having escaped seemed
utterly preposterous to Mr. Stagg. He arose to
depart.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, you won’t say anything to the child
to disturb her mind,” he said. “Poor little thing!
It’s hard enough for her as it is.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll keep my jaws clamped shut like a clam,
mister,” declared the sailor.
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda followed the hardware dealer to
the outer door. She hesitated to speak, yet Mr.
Stagg’s unhappy face won an observation from her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t you suppose there is <em>any</em> chance of
their being alive?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
“After all these months?” groaned Mr. Stagg.
“The old fellow may tell the truth, as far as he’s
gone, and as far as he knows; but if they were alive
we’d have heard about it before now. That African
coast isn’t a desert—nor yet a wilderness—nowadays.
Those Arabs have been pretty well tamed, I
reckon. No, we’d have heard long before this.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry,” said Miss Amanda simply.
</p>
<p>
“Thank—thank you,” murmured Joseph Stagg
before she closed the door.
</p>
<p>
He went on to town, his mind strangely disturbed.
It was not his sister’s fate that filled his heart and
brain, but thoughts of Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
She had deliberately broken the silence of years!
Of course, it might be attributed to her interest in
Carolyn May only, yet the hardware dealer wondered.
</p>
<p>
He could not get interested in the big ledger that
afternoon. Old Jimmy, the cat, leaped upon his
desk, purring, and walked right across the fair page
of the book, making an awful smudge where the ink
was not dry, and Joseph Stagg merely said: “Scat,
Jimmy!” and paid no further attention.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
Out through the office window he stared, and out
of the transom above the front door. He could see
a blue patch of sky, across which now and then a
grey-white cloud floated. In those floating clouds
Mr. Stagg began to read a future which had little
to do with the dull prospect of the hardware store
itself.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Look up!</em>”
</p>
<p>
The thought came to him while his countenance
was a-smile. His reverie had surely inspired a pleasanter
feeling within and a happier expression without.
Carolyn May’s reiterated phrase rather startled
Joseph Stagg.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the child’s right,” he murmured. “It’s
looking up makes a man dream of happiness. But—it’s
only a dream, I reckon. Only a dream.”
</p>
<p>
His immediate thoughts did not fall into the old
groove, however. Not at once. When he went
home to supper that evening he boldly stared at the
Parlow house, on the watch for something. There
were lights in the kitchen and the dining-room. And
was that a figure moving cautiously behind the lace
curtains at the front-room window?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—SOMETHING CAROLYN MAY WISHES TO KNOW</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May’s heart was filled with
trouble. She had, ere this, proved herself
to be a deeply thoughtful child, and the
grown people about her did not suspect how much
she was disturbed by a new subject of thought.
</p>
<p>
This was the result of her first talk with the old
sailor. Not from him, nor from anybody else, did
Carolyn May get any direct information that the
sailor had been aboard the <em>Dunraven</em> on her fatal
voyage. But his story awoke in the child’s breast
doubts and longings, uncertainties and desires that
had lain dormant for many weeks.
</p>
<p>
“I do wish, Princey,” she told her mongrel friend,
her single really close confidant, “that my papa and
mamma were like the folks buried there behind the
church,” and she sighed.
</p>
<p>
“I’d know just where they were, then. That
part of ’em that’s dead, I mean. But now we don’t
know much about it, do we?
</p>
<p>
“Being lost at sea is such a dreadful unsatisfactory
way of having your folks dead.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe and Aunty Rose loved her and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
kind to her. But that feeling of “emptiness” that
had at first so troubled Carolyn May was returning.
Kind as her new friends here at The Corners and at
Sunrise Cove were, there was something lacking in
the little girl’s life.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could make up to her for the jolly companionship
of her father. Even while his health
was declining, he had made all about him happier
by his own cheerful spirit. And the little girl longed,
more and more, for her mother. She had followed
her father’s axiom to “look up” and had benefited
by it; but, at last, her loneliness and homesickness
had become, it seemed, too great to endure.
</p>
<p>
She began to droop. Keen-eyed Aunty Rose discovered
this physical change very quickly.
</p>
<p>
“She’s just like a droopy chicken,” declared the
good woman, “and, goodness knows, I have seen
enough of them.”
</p>
<p>
So, as a stimulant and a preventive of “droopiness,”
Aunty Rose prescribed boneset tea, “plenty
of it.” Now, she loved Carolyn May very much,
even if she could not bring herself to the point of
showing her affection before others; but boneset tea
is an awful dose!
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May took the prescribed quantity and
shook all over. She could not bear the taste of
bitter things, and this boneset, or thoroughwort, had
the very bitterest taste she had ever encountered.
</p>
<p>
“Do—do you think it’s good for me, Aunty
Rose?” she asked quaveringly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
“It certainly is, Carolyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—<em>but</em>,” returned the little girl, “wouldn’t
something else do me good—only, maybe, slower—that
wasn’t so awfully bitter? I—I’m afraid I’ll
never learn to like this boneset tea—not really,
Aunty Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“We are not supposed to like medicine,” declared
Aunty Rose, being a confirmed allopath.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, aren’t we?” the little girl cried. “I ’member
being sick once—at home, with my mamma and
papa—and a doctor came. A real nice doctor, with
eyeglasses. And he gave me cunning little pills of
different colours. I didn’t mind taking them; they
were like candy.”
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose shook her head decidedly and negatively.
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe in such remedies,” she said.
“Medicine is like punishment—unless it hurts, of
what use is it?”
</p>
<p>
Therefore three times a day Carolyn May was
dosed with boneset tea. How long the child’s
stomach would have endured under this treatment
will never be known. Carolyn May got no better,
that was sure; but one day something happened.
</p>
<p>
Winter had moved on in its usual frosty and snowy
way. Carolyn May had kept up all her interests—after
a fashion. She went to school, and she visited
Miss Amanda, and her sailor man held her attention.
But they were just surface interests. “Inside” she
was all sick, and sorry, and prone to tears; and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
was not altogether the boneset tea that made her
feel so unsettled, either.
</p>
<p>
Benjamin Hardy had gone to Adams’ camp to
work. It seemed he could use a peavy, or canthook,
pretty well, having done something besides sailing
in his day. Tim, the hackman, worked at logging in
the winter months, too. He usually went past the
Stagg place with a team four times each day.
</p>
<p>
There was something Carolyn May wished to ask
Benjamin Hardy, but she did not want anybody else
to know what it was—not even Uncle Joe or Aunty
Rose. Miss Amanda had gone across town to stay
with a lady who was ill, so the little girl could not
take her into her confidence, had she so wished.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it was the seaman Carolyn May wished
to talk with, and she laid her plans accordingly.
Once in the fall and before the snow came she had
ridden as far as Adams’ camp with Mr. Parlow. He
had gone there for some hickory wood.
</p>
<p>
But, now, to ride on the empty sled going in and
on top of the load of logs coming out of the forest,
Carolyn May felt sure, would be much more exciting.
She mentioned her desire to Uncle Joe on a
Friday evening.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, if it’s pleasant, I don’t see anything
to forbid. Do you, Aunty Rose?” Mr. Stagg
returned.
</p>
<p>
“I presume Tim will take the best of care of her,”
the woman said. “Maybe getting out more in the
air will make her look less peaked, Joseph Stagg.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer stared at his little niece with
knitted brow.
</p>
<p>
“Does she look peaked, Aunty Rose?” he asked
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“She doesn’t look as robust as I could wish.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! she isn’t sick, is she? You don’t feel bad,
do you, Car’lyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Uncle Joe,” the child hastened to say,
remembering vividly the boneset tea. “I’m quite
sure I’m not ill.”
</p>
<p>
The excitement of preparing to go to the camp
the next morning brought the roses into Carolyn
May’s cheeks and made her eyes sparkle. When
Tim, the hackman, went into town with his first
load he was forewarned by Aunty Rose that he
would have company going back.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” exclaimed
Tim. “The boys will near ’bout take a holiday.
You tell her to put on her red hood and a blue hair-ribbon,
and she’ll be as purty as a posy to go
a-visiting.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind what she wears, Timothy,” said
Aunty Rose sternly. “You see that she gets back
here safely.”
</p>
<p>
“Surest thing you know, Miz Kennedy,” agreed
the man.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May—and, of course, Prince—were
ready when Tim came back with the empty sled, or
“jumper,” as he called it. He had thrown a number
of sacks upon it, on which she might sit, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
started off briskly. The bells on the horses’ collars
jingled a merry tune.
</p>
<p>
Prince bounded about the sled in wild delight,
barking madly. Such an adventure as this was quite
to his liking.
</p>
<p>
“I vow!” croaked Timothy, “I’ve often thought
I’d like to be a dog—some men’s dog, I mean. They
ain’t got nothin’ to trouble ’em—’nless it’s a few
fleas. And maybe <em>they</em> ain’t such a heavy cross and
burden. They give the dog good healthy exercise
a-scratchin’ of ’em.
</p>
<p>
“Now, look at that Prince critter, will you? He’s
all of a broad grin—happy as a clam at high water.
He don’t hafter worry about rent, or clo’es, or how
to meet the next payment on the pianner. He sure
is in an easy state of mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Carolyn May agreed, “I think Prince is
a very cheerful dog. Why, he almost laughs sometimes!”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon he does,” agreed Tim. “Only, dumb
critters don’t never really laff.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, they do!” cried Carolyn May, eager
to give information when she could. “Anyhow,
<em>some</em> animals do.”
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” ejaculated
the man. “What animals, I’d be proud ter know?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, there were some of them at the Zoo.
That’s ’way up in the Bronx, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the Brow-n-x?” interrupted Tim as they
jounced along.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, it’s a park. Bigger’n Central Park,
you know—oh! ever so much bigger. And they
have lots of animals—wild animals.”
</p>
<p>
“Not <em>loose</em>?” cried her listener.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. That is, not all of them. Some are in
big fields, or yards; but there are fences up.”
</p>
<p>
“Yep, I sh’d hope so,” returned Tim. “And, if
I was goin’ to visit ’em, I sh’d want them fences
to be horse high, hog tight, and bull strong. I
sure would!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, but the laughing hyenas are in cages,” explained
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Do tell! An’ do they laff? They must be good-natured
critters, after all, them—what d’ye call
’em—laffin’ hannahs?”
</p>
<p>
“Hy-<em>e</em>-nas,” repeated Carolyn May carefully.
“They look something like dogs—only they aren’t.
And they look something like zebras—only they
aren’t. And when they do laugh, Mr. Tim, it just
makes the cold chills run up and down your back.
Oh, they are dreadful ugly beasts! So laughing
don’t always make things good-natured, does it?”
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” murmured
Tim, the hackman, staring at her wide-eyed. “What
a ’magination that young one’s got!”
</p>
<p>
But the little girl did not hear this comment, else
she would have been unhappy.
</p>
<p>
They jogged along very comfortably, reaching
the camp a little before noon. Adams’ camp was
the largest lumber camp near Sunrise Cove; but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
was a raw-looking place—nothing but a clump of
sheet-iron sheds and log huts.
</p>
<p>
The snow on the roofs, and the fact that the drifts
hid many unsightly things, made the place seem less
crude than it really was. Still, Carolyn May was
doubtful as to whether or not she would like to live
there.
</p>
<p>
There was but one woman in the camp, Judy
Mason. She lived in one of the log huts with her
husband. He was a sawyer, and Judy did the men’s
washing.
</p>
<p>
Benjamin Hardy was pleased, indeed, to see his
little friend again. She sought him out as soon as
the engineer blew the whistle for the noon rest, and
they went into the bunk-house together, where more
than forty men gathered around the long table for
dinner.
</p>
<p>
There was no tablecloth, and the food was served
in basins, and they ate off tin pie plates, and drank
out of tin mugs. But the men were a jolly crowd,
and the dinner hour was enlivened by jokes and good-natured
foolery.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May appreciated their attempts to amuse
her, but she clung close to Benjamin, for she had a
question in her mind that only he, she thought, could
answer.
</p>
<p>
“You come with me, please,” she whispered to
the old seaman after dinner. “You can smoke.
You haven’t got to go back to work yet, and Tim is
only just loading his sled. So we can talk.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, little miss. What’ll we talk about?”
queried Benjamin cautiously, for he remembered that
he was to be very circumspect in his conversation
with her.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to tell me something, Benjamin,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
“Sail ahead, matey,” he responded with apparent
heartiness, filling his pipe meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Benjamin—you must know, you know, for
you’ve been to sea so much—Benjamin, I want to
know if it hurts much to be drownd-ed?”
</p>
<p>
“Hurts much?” gasped the old seaman.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. Do people that get drownd-ed feel
much pain? Is it a sufferin’ way to die? I want to
know, Benjamin, ’cause my papa and mamma died
that way,” continued the child, choking a little. “It
does seem as though I’d just <em>got</em> to know.”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye,” muttered the man. “I see. An’ I
kin tell ye, Car’lyn May, as clos’t as anybody kin.
I’ve been so near drownin’ myself that they thought
I was dead when I was hauled inboard.
</p>
<p>
“That was when I sailed in the old <em>Paducah</em>, a
cotton boat, from N’Orleans to Liverpool. That
was long ’fore I got to runnin’ on the Cross and
Crescent Line boats, ’cause steamships is easier to
work on than sailin’ vessels.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, listen. We used to carry almighty
cargoes—yes’m. Decks loaded till we could scarce
handle sail. She was down to the mark, and then
some. An’ if it come on to blow, we was all in
danger of our lives. Owners cared more for freight
money than they did for the lives of her crew.”

<p>
“Oh! How very wicked!” exclaimed Carolyn
May, her mind led somewhat away from the gruesome
question she had propounded to Benjamin.
</p>
<p>
“’Twas that, indeed,” agreed the sailor, puffing
on his pipe. “The old <em>Paducah</em> sometimes rolled
through the wash like she was top-heavy. And if
the swell got too strong for her we had to jettison
the top tiers of cotton bales—pitch ’em overboard,
you see.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“An’ one day, when the old craft was rollin’ till
her yards nigh touched the sea, I was loosin’ the
upper tier of bales and slidin’ ’em overboard, when
over <em>I</em> went with one of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Benjamin! Never!”
</p>
<p>
“Aye, aye, matey. That’s what I done,” said the
old man, sucking away on his pipe. “There was
me in the sea, hangin’ on to a balehook that was stuck
in the cotton. The old <em>Paducah</em> rushed by me, it
seemed, like an express train past a cripple.”
</p>
<p>
“But you weren’t drownd-ed!” exclaimed Carolyn
May.
</p>
<p>
“No-o. But I was near it—mighty near it. They
seen me go, an’ I heard the cry, ‘Man overboard!’
when I come up after my first plunge. I knowed
they’d wear ship and send a boat after me. So, first
off, I thought I’d hang to the balehook and be all
right.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“But I got ’nough o’ that soon—yes’m! The
waves was monster tall. One seized me and the bale
o’ cotton, an’ we shot right up to the crest of it.
Then I found myself fallin’ down on ’tother side,
an’ that cotton bale tumblin’ after me. I had to get
out o’ the way of that bale in a hurry, or it might
have swiped me a blow that I’d never come up from.
An’ I wasn’t much of a swimmer.”
</p>
<p>
The little girl’s eyes were round with interest and
her lips were parted. She drank in every word the
old sailor uttered.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there I was, little miss,” he said, still puffing
on his pipe. “There was sev’ral of them cotton
bales had been slid overboard about the same time,
an’ I found myself a-dodgin’ of ’em. Fust one, then
another, come after me—it seemed as if they was
determined to git me.
</p>
<p>
“When I warn’t lookin’ for it, the end of one
bale clumped me right in the back. I went down
that time, I thought, for keeps.
</p>
<p>
“Down and down I went, till all I could see above
me was green water streaked with white. I couldn’t
git my breath; but otherwise, mind ye, I wasn’t in
much trouble. I jest floated there, and I didn’t much
care to come up. I didn’t care for anything.
</p>
<p>
“Lots o’ things I’d done, good an’ bad, chased
through my head,” went on Benjamin. “I remembered
folks I hadn’t thought of for years. My
mother and father come to me—jest as plain! An’
them dead for a long time.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! did you see <em>ghosts</em>?” Carolyn May exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Not to frighten me,” the sailor assured her.
“It was jest as though I was sittin’ in a rockin’-chair,
half asleep, an’ these dreams come to me. I warn’t
in any pain. It was a lot worse when the boys
reached me in the boat an’ hauled me inboard.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Then</em>,” said the old man with vigour, “it cost
me something. Comin’ back from drowning is a
whole lot worse than bein’ drowned. You take it
from me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” sighed Carolyn May, “I’m glad to know
that. It’s bothered me a good deal. If my mamma
and papa had to be dead, maybe that was the nicest
way for them to go.
</p>
<p>
“Only—only,” confessed the little girl, “I’d feel
so much better if they’d been brought back and we
could have buried them behind the church, like
Aunty Rose’s babies and her spouse. And—and I’d
feel better yet if they weren’t dead at all!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—A GOOD DEAL OF EXCITEMENT</h2>
<p>
Tim, the hackman, had an accident to his load
before he was ready to start from the camp
after dinner. He was hauling maple and
other hardwood logs to the turning mill at Sunrise
Cove; and, the team he worked being a sturdy pair
of animals, he piled a heavy cargo on the jumper.
Just as he called to Carolyn May to hop upon the
load for the ride home the horses started.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you!” sang out the hack driver. “What
d’ye think you’re doin’? Hey, there! Whoa!”
</p>
<p>
Unguided, the horses brought the sled with a
vicious crash against a snow-covered stump. The
load rocked, one runner hoisted into the air, and the
load toppled over completely. The log-chain could
not stand such a strain, and right there and then
occurred a notable overturn.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” bawled Tim.
“Now look what you went and done!”
</p>
<p>
He declaimed this against the spirited team. The
whole camp yelled its delight.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t fit to drive anything more lively than
that old rackabones you tackle to your hack in summer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
Tim,” declared the boss of the camp. “You
don’t know nothing about managing a real horse.”
</p>
<p>
“Hi, Timmy!” called another, “want somebody
to hold their heads while ye build up that load
again?”
</p>
<p>
But the hackman accepted this good-naturedly.
He was delayed quite an hour, however, in starting
from the camp with Carolyn May; and an hour out
of a winter’s afternoon is a good deal, for it becomes
dark early at that time of year.
</p>
<p>
When Tim had his load perfectly secure again he
tossed the sacks on the logs, and then lifted Carolyn
May to the top. Prince whined and barked at her.
Her eminence was too great for him to gain.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, Princey,” she called to him.
“You’d rather run, you know you would. We’re
going home now.”
</p>
<p>
The men in sight swung their caps and called their
good-byes after her. Judy Mason flapped her apron
from the cabin door. The sailor reached up to shake
her mittened hand. This time the horses started
properly, and, groaning, the heavily laden sled swung
into the beaten track.
</p>
<p>
The sun was already down; a silver paring of
moon hung above the tree tops, growing brighter
each minute as the daylight faded. The stars would
soon begin to sparkle in the heavens. The track led
through the thick wood, which quickly hid the camp
and all its busy scene from view.
</p>
<p>
Timothy had climbed to the top of the load, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
and settled himself comfortably for the ride. He
proceeded to fill and light his pipe.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you ever scared that there might be bears
or something in the woods, Mr. Timothy?” Carolyn
May asked him, looking about in some trepidation.
“Of course, with Prince here, I know that no wild
animal could steal upon us. But when you’re
alone?”
</p>
<p>
Tim chuckled. “Bears don’t pedestrianate around
in winter—not as ever I heard on,” he said.
“They’ve got too much sense. Bears hole up when
the snow flies. An’, b’sides, they’re ain’t no bears.
All done away with long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure?” Carolyn May asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Sure as shootin’. Pitcher of George Washington!
think I’d go traipsin’ through these woods without
no gun,” Tim asked, grinning at her, “if there
was anything fiercer’n a polecat to be met up with?
An’, come to think of it, <em>they</em> hole up in winter, too.
Gid-ap, there, ye lazybones!”
</p>
<p>
The horses nodded their heads, as though agreeing
with all he had said; the bells tinkled and the
sled runners crunched over the snow. Prince did
not feel so much like “cavorting,” as Tim called it,
and followed the sled at a sober gait. The woods
were very silent. Not a bird winged its way across
their path, and all the rabbits seemed to have hidden
themselves. The little girl began to nod and her
eyes blinked.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, on the branch of a tree that overhung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
the road they were following, Carolyn May saw a
grey, furry body hugging close to the limb.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what’s that?” she gasped, scarcely loud
enough for Tim to hear.
</p>
<p>
At one end of the grey body a round, catlike head
was thrust out over the branch—the eyes yellow and
glaring, the pointed ears erect.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a big cat!” Carolyn May cried,
louder now. “See there!”
</p>
<p>
Tim, the hackman, turned in startled haste. At
her cry the animal on the limb gathered its legs
under it, arched its back, and uttered a startling
screech.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” murmured Carolyn May, “he’s
seen Prince.”
</p>
<p>
This was probably the case, for the creature repeated
its yowl, just like an enraged tom-cat, only
much louder than even old Jimmy could squall. Tim
yelled to the horses and bent forward to lash them
with the slack of the reins.
</p>
<p>
They leaped ahead, but not soon enough to carry
the loaded sled out from under the limb. Prince,
who had uttered a challenging growl, danced around
the trunk of the tree. The huge cat leaped!
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! Oh, my!” shrieked Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
She did not realise the full danger of the situation.
A mad lynx is no pleasant beast to meet; and this
one, when it leaped, landed upon the rear of the load
of logs.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” yelled Tim,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
the hackman. “We’re boarded by pirates, sure
enough!”
</p>
<p>
The squalling, clawing brute tried to draw itself
up on the logs. The horses were running now, and
the jolting of the sled made the beast’s hold precarious.
Besides, just as the cat landed, Prince
darted around to the rear of the sled. With a growl
of rage, the big mongrel flung himself upward and
managed to seize the lynx just at the root of its
stubby tail.
</p>
<p>
Then there was a squalling time, indeed! The
cat, clawing and spitting, sought to retain its hold
on the logs, and yet strike at its adversary.
</p>
<p>
Prince had claws of his own, and he was scratching
at the logs to gain a foothold; but his claws were
not like the sabre-sharp nails of the lynx. A single
thrust of a spread paw of the cat would have raked
poor Prince’s hide to shreds.
</p>
<p>
With the horses galloping and the lynx jouncing,
half on and half off the logs, there was little likelihood
of the wildcat’s turning on its enemy. There
was enough bull in Prince to clamp his jaws in
an unbreakable hold, now that he had gripped the
lynx.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was thoroughly frightened. She
had to cling with both hands to save herself from
being flung from the sled. Tim began to realise, at
length, that he must do something besides yell at the
horses.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington!” he gurgled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
“That blamed wood-pussy’s gotter git off this load!
I didn’t come out here to give it a ride, I vum!”
</p>
<p>
He hung the reins on one of the sled stakes, seized
a hickory club as thick as his forearm, and crept
back towards the angry animal.
</p>
<p>
The dog’s weight hanging to its tail was giving
the lynx about all it could think of or take care of;
yet it spat at Tim and struck at him with one paw.
</p>
<p>
“Would ye, ye nasty beast?” cried Tim, rising
to his feet. “Scat!”
</p>
<p>
He struck at the head of the lynx with his club.
That blow certainly would have done some execution
had it landed where Tim intended it to land—on the
creature’s head. But, instead, the end of the club
came down with great force on a log.
</p>
<p>
The blow had a tremendous effect, but not in the
way Tim expected. The jar of the stroke almost
paralysed the man’s arm. He uttered a groan and
staggered back. The sled runner went over a hummock
just then on one side of the trail, while the
runner on the other side sank into a rut. Like a diver
from a springboard, Tim went head first, and backward,
into a snowbank beside the road.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George—” The rest of his favourite
ejaculation was smothered by the snow, into which
he plunged so deeply that only his felt boots, kicking
heavenward, were to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the sled lumbered on, although the
reckless pace of the horses was reduced.
</p>
<p>
The peril to the little girl on the pile of logs increased,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
however, as the pace of the horses decreased.
She was quite helpless, save that she managed
to retain her grasp on the log-chain. But there
was nobody to protect her now from the furious
beast that was making its best endeavour to crawl to
the top of the logs.
</p>
<p>
If the lynx shook the mongrel loose it would attain
its desire. Assured of a footing on the logs, there
was no knowing what it might do in its rage. Carolyn
May was in the gravest peril.
</p>
<p>
The child was too excited to cry out again. She
clung with her mittened hands to the chain and gazed
back at the snarling, spitting lynx with wide-open,
terrified eyes.
</p>
<p>
Both beasts were scratching and tearing at the logs
to obtain a foothold; the lynx was energetically trying
to drag itself and the dog farther up on the logs,
while Prince was striving to pull down his prey.
</p>
<p>
The dog seemed to know his little mistress was in
danger. He was not going to let go. It was the lynx
that finally gave in.
</p>
<p>
Squalling and clawing, its nails stripping long
splinters from the maple logs, the cat fell back.
When the two animals struck the hard snow, Prince
was shaken off.
</p>
<p>
But the mongrel was brave. He dived in again
and seized the lynx, this time by the throat. The cat
got in a stroke with its hind paws. The lacerations
along Prince’s side were deep and painful, but he
held to his prey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the horses plunged on, dragging the
loaded sled over the rough road at a pace which still
imperiled the little girl. Each moment she might be
shaken from her hold and flung from the logs into
the roadway.
</p>
<p>
Should she fall, it was not likely that she would
escape harm, as had Tim, the hackman. He had
now struggled out of the drift unhurt, and came
staggering along the track, shouting in futile fashion
for his team to stop.
</p>
<p>
Oddly enough, he had clung to the club all this
time, and, reaching the bloody patch of snow where
the dog and the lynx struggled, he set upon the big
cat and beat it so about the head that it was very
quickly dead.
</p>
<p>
“Come on! Come on!” Tim shouted to the dog.
“You ain’t got to stay here and growl at that critter
no more. <em>Ketch them horses!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Prince actually seemed to know what Tim meant.
Sore and bleeding as he was, the dog did not halt
even to lick his wounds. He dashed ahead, barking,
and quickly overtook the sled. The horses were not
going very fast now, but they were not minded to
halt, for all of Tim’s shouting.
</p>
<p>
Prince sprang at the nigh horse and seized its
bridle rein. The team swerved out of the path,
Prince hanging on and growling.
</p>
<p>
The sled struck an obstruction and the team
stopped.
</p>
<p>
“Pitcher of George Washington! if that ain’t a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
smart dog, I never see one,” gasped Tim, panting
and blowing. “Air ye hurt, Car’lyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess not, Mr. Timothy,” answered the
little girl.
</p>
<p>
“I never seen the beat of this in all my born days,”
declared the man. “And that dog——”
</p>
<p>
“Prince is just the very <em>best</em> dog!” Carolyn May
affirmed. “Oh, Mr. Timothy, take me down, quick!
Poor Princey is all bloody; he must be hurt!”
</p>
<p>
“He is hurt some. That lynx raked him once, I
’low,” returned Tim. “But he’ll be all right when
ye git him home and put something on the scratches.
My goodness! what an exciting time! I never did
see the beat of it!”
</p>
<p>
This statement Tim continued to repeat all the
way to The Corners. He set Carolyn May back on
the load again and hoisted Prince up with her, but
he walked himself beside the team.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t goin’ to take no more risks. Pitcher of
George Washington! I guess not. Dunno what
your Uncle Joe and Aunty Rose’ll say to me.”
</p>
<p>
The story lost nothing in the telling when Tim, the
hackman, and Carolyn May both related it at the
Stagg homestead. And poor Prince’s wounds spoke
louder than words.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t been a wildcat in this county afore in five
year,” declared Tim. “And I’m sartain sure there
never was one here more savage.”
</p>
<p>
When Uncle Joe saw Tim in the village and heard
about the adventure he hastened home to make sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
that his little niece had received no injury. Prince
was enthroned on an old quilt beside the range.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose had herself washed his wounds—though
she admitted being afraid of his savage-looking
teeth—and had put some healing balsam on
them. The dog, evidently enjoying his role of invalid,
looked up at Mr. Stagg and slapped his tail
on the floor.
</p>
<p>
“If it hadn’t been for that dumb creature, Joseph
Stagg,” said Aunty Rose, still quite shaken over the
incident, “we wouldn’t maybe have our little girl
unhurt. If Timothy tells the truth——”
</p>
<p>
“I guess he tells the truth, all right,” snorted Mr.
Stagg. “He don’t know enough to tell anything but
truth. Howsomever, if he’d stopped his team, he
could have licked that old lynx to a fare-ye-well. I
wouldn’t trust Hannah’s Car’lyn with him again—not
even to go to church.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Uncle Joe,” said Carolyn May, “you
can’t really blame Mr. Timothy for being scared at
that awful wildcat. I was scared myself.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—THE SPRING FRESHET</h2>
<p>
Since Joseph Stagg had listened to the rambling
tale of the sailor regarding the sinking
of the <em>Dunraven</em>, he had borne the fate of his
sister and her husband much in mind.
</p>
<p>
He had come no nearer to deciding what to do
with the apartment in New York and its furnishings.
Carolyn May had prattled so much about her home
that Mr. Stagg felt as though he knew each room
and each piece of furniture. And, should he go
down to New York and make arrangements to have
his sister’s possessions taken to an auction room, he
would feel on entering the flat as though the ghosts
of Carolyn May’s parents would meet him there.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Price had written him twice about the place.
The second time he had found a tenant willing to sublet
the furnished apartment. It would have made a
little income for Carolyn May, but Mr. Stagg could
not bring himself to sign the lease. The lawyer had
not written since.
</p>
<p>
After listening to Benjamin Hardy’s story, the
hardware dealer felt less inclined than before to
close up the affairs of Carolyn May’s small “estate.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
Not that he for one moment believed that there was
a possibility of Hannah and her husband being alive.
Five months had passed. In these days of wireless
telegraph and fast sea traffic such a thing could not
be possible. The imagination of the practical hardware
merchant could not visualise it.
</p>
<p>
Had the purser’s boat, in which the old sailor declared
the Camerons were, been picked up by one
of the Turkish ships, as the other refugees from the
<em>Dunraven</em> had been rescued by the French vessel,
surely news of the fact would long since have reached
the papers, even had circumstances kept Mr. and
Mrs. Cameron from returning home.
</p>
<p>
The Mediterranean is not the South Seas. A
steam vessel could reach New York from the spot
where the <em>Dunraven</em> had sunk in a week.
</p>
<p>
No, Mr. Stagg held no shred of belief that
Hannah and her husband were not drowned.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not speak of the tragedy; yet it
was continually in the child’s mind. Her conversation
with the sailor regarding the sufferings of
drowning people only touched a single phase of the
little girl’s trouble.
</p>
<p>
She was glad to be assured that her parents had
not lingered in agony when they met their fate. She
accepted the sailor’s statement regarding drowning
quite at its par value. Nevertheless, neither this
interview with Benjamin Hardy at the lumber camp
nor Aunty Rose’s copious doses of boneset tea
cheered the little girl. The excitement of the adventure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
with the lynx lasted only a few hours. Then
the cloud returned to Carolyn May’s countenance
and she drooped once more.
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie noticed it. By this time the sharp-eyed
young teacher looked through her spectacles
very kindly at the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“What is the trouble with you, Carolyn May?”
the teacher asked on one occasion. “You used to
be the happiest little girl in The Corners school; and
you were brightening up everybody else, too. I
don’t like to see you so glum and thoughtful. It
isn’t like you. What about your ‘<em>look up</em>’ motto,
my dear? Have you forgotten it?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t forgotten that—oh, no, Miss Minnie.
I <em>couldn’t</em> forget that!” the child replied. “I ’spect
my papa would be ’shamed of me for losing heart so.
But, oh, Miss Minnie! I <em>do</em> get such an empty feeling
now when I think of my papa and mamma. And
I think of them ’most all the time. It just does seem
as though they were going farther and farther away
from me ev’ry day!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Minnie took the child in her arms and kissed
her.
</p>
<p>
“Faithful little soul!” she murmured. “Time
will never heal heart wounds for her.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda understood Carolyn May, too.
When the child went to the Parlow house she found
sympathy and comfort in abundance.
</p>
<p>
Not that Aunty Rose and Uncle Joe were not sympathetic;
but they did not wholly understand the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
child’s nature. As the winter passed and Carolyn
May grew more and more quiet, the hardware dealer
and the woman who kept house for him decided that
there was nothing the matter with Carolyn May save
the natural changes incident to her growing up. For,
physically, she was growing fast. As Aunty Rose
said to Mr. Stagg, she was “stretching right out of
her clothes.”
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May did not always keep out of mischief,
for she was a very human little girl, after all
was said and done. Especially was she prone to
escapades when she was in the company of Freda
Payne, her black-eyed school chum.
</p>
<p>
Trouble seemed to gravitate towards Freda. Not
that she was intentionally naughty, but she was too
active and too full of curiosity to lead a very placid
existence. Wherever Freda was the storm clouds of
trouble soon gathered.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May and Freda were playing one Saturday
afternoon in the long shed that connected the
blacksmith shop with Mr. Lardner’s house, and
Amos Bartlett was with them.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not often play with little boys.
She did not much approve of them. They often
played roughly and it must be confessed that their
hands almost always were grubby. But she rather
pitied Amos Bartlett because he had been endowed
with a nose so generous that the other children
laughed at him and called him “Nosey.” He
snuffled, and he talked nasally, which made Carolyn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
May shudder sometimes, but she was brave about it
when in Amos’ company.
</p>
<p>
The three were playing in Mr. Hiram Lardner’s
shed, which was half storeroom and half workshop.
Back in a corner the inquisitive Freda found a great
cask filled with something very yellow and foamy
and delicious to look at.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, molasses, I do believe!” exclaimed Freda
eagerly. “Don’t you s’pose it’s molasses, Car’lyn
May? I just love molasses!”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was fond of syrup, too; and this
barrelful certainly looked like the kind Aunty
Rose sometimes put on the table for the griddle
cakes. The little girl liked it better than she did
maple syrup.
</p>
<p>
“I believe it is molasses,” she agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a tin cup to drink it with,” put in Amos.
</p>
<p>
“O-oh! Would you dare taste it, Car’lyn May?”
cried Freda.
</p>
<p>
“No. I’d rather not. Besides, it isn’t ours,”
Carolyn May returned virtuously.
</p>
<p>
“But there’s so much of it,” urged Freda. “I’m
sure Mr. Lardner wouldn’t care—nor Mrs. Lardner,
either.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but maybe it isn’t molasses,” Carolyn May
suggested.
</p>
<p>
“I bet it is m’lasses,” declared Amos with a longing
look.
</p>
<p>
“You try it, Amos,” ordered Freda, handing him
the cup.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Carolyn May coolly. “You’re a boy,
and boys don’t mind messing into things. Just taste
it, Amos.”
</p>
<p>
“Go on, Amos,” added Freda. “I dare you. I
double-double dare you!”
</p>
<p>
Of course, Amos, boylike, could not take a dare,
so he dipped the tin cup into the yellow, foamy mass
and took a good big swallow. Then the trouble
began.
</p>
<p>
He dropped the cup into the barrel, where it
immediately disappeared from sight, while Amos
hopped about, sputtering, coughing, crying, and generally
acting like a boy distracted.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m pizened! I’m pizened!” he bawled.
“And you girls done it! I’m—I’m goin’ to tell my
mother!”
</p>
<p>
His shrieks brought Mrs. Lardner from her
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun are you children up to?”
she demanded. “Amos Bartlett, behave yourself!
What is it?”
</p>
<p>
Amos could not tell her. All he could shriek was
that he was “pizened.”
</p>
<p>
He burst out of the shed, ran through the shop,
and so home to his mother. Carolyn May was too
frightened to speak, but Freda said shakingly:
“We only got him to taste the molasses.”
</p>
<p>
“What molasses?” demanded the blacksmith’s
wife, startled.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why—<em>that</em>,” said Freda, pointing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“My mercy me!” gasped the woman. “That
soft soap that Hiram just made for me? I don’t
know but the boy is poisoned.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Lardner rushed after Amos, to see if she
could help his mother. Carolyn May and Freda
crept quietly home, two frightened little girls.
</p>
<p>
But Amos was not poisoned. The doctor brought
him around all right. Freda suffered an old-fashioned
spanking for her part in the performance; but
Aunty Rose, who did not believe in corporal punishment,
did not at first know what to do to Carolyn
May.
</p>
<p>
“She should be punished, Joseph Stagg,” the
housekeeper said to the hardware dealer. “I’ve put
her to bed early——”
</p>
<p>
“Not without her supper?” he asked in alarm,
dropping his own knife and fork.
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” she admitted. “I couldn’t do that.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg chuckled. “I reckon children are
children,” he observed. “I don’t know as Hannah’s
Car’lyn is any different from the rest.”
</p>
<p>
“I know one thing, Joseph Stagg,” said Aunty
Rose severely. “If you ever have children of your
own they will be utterly spoiled.”
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Stagg still seemed amused.
</p>
<p>
“If you had anything to do with ’em, I’d have
plenty of help in spoiling ’em, Aunty Rose,” he
declared.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May took the matter somewhat seriously.
She tried to make it up to Amos Bartlett by lending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
him her sled, giving him candy when she had it, and
otherwise petting him.
</p>
<p>
“For he <em>might</em> have been poisoned,” she stated;
“and then he’d be dead, and would <em>never</em> grow up
to fit his nose.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May’s acquaintance broadened constantly.
She made friends wherever she went, and the wintry
weather did not often keep her in the house. Uncle
Joe would not hear of her going into the woods
again, unless he was with her, but she could go where
she pleased among the neighbours.
</p>
<p>
At Sunrise Cove there were many people who
loved Carolyn May Cameron. Her most faithful
knight, however, was homely, optimistic Chetwood
Gormley. Mr. Stagg declared that when Chet saw
“Hannah’s Car’lyn” approaching he “grinned so
wide that he was like to swallow his own ears.”
</p>
<p>
And they would have been a mouthful. Even
Mrs. Gormley, who could see few faults in her son,
declared that Chet “wasn’t behind the door when
ears were given out.”
</p>
<p>
“Chet’s got a generous nature,” the good woman
said to Carolyn May one day when the latter was
making the seamstress a little visit. “It don’t take
his ears to show that, though they <em>do</em>. He’d do anything
for a friend. But I don’t know as he’s ’preciated
as much as he’d oughter be,” sighed Mrs.
Gormley. “Mr. Stagg, even, don’t know Chet’s
good parts.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, Mrs. Gormley, I think Uncle Joe knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
all about Chet’s ears. He couldn’t hardly miss ’em,”
the little girl hastened to observe.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! I didn’t mean actual parts of his
body,” Mrs. Gormley replied, eyeing the little girl
over her spectacles. “I mean character. He’s a
fine boy, Car’lyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I think he is, too,” agreed the child.
“And I’m sure Uncle Joe ’preciates him.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hope so,” sighed the seamstress. “You
can’t much tell just what Mr. Joe Stagg thinks of
folks. There’s him and Mandy Parlow. Somebody
was tellin’ me Mr. Stagg was seen comin’ out o’ the
Parlow house one day. But, shucks! <em>that</em> ain’t so, of
course?” and she looked narrowly at her little
visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wish he <em>would</em> make up with Miss
Amanda,” sighed Carolyn May. “She’s <em>so</em> nice.”
</p>
<p>
“And I guess he thought so, too—once. But you
can’t tell, as I say. Mr. Joe Stagg is a man that
never lets on what’s in his mind.”
</p>
<p>
Just then in burst Chet, quite unexpectedly, for it
was not yet mid-afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! Mercy me!” gasped Mrs. Gormley.
“What <em>is</em> the matter, Chetwood? Mr. Stagg
hain’t let you go, has he?”
</p>
<p>
“Let me go? Well, there, mother, I wish you
warn’t always expectin’ trouble,” Chet said, though
smiling widely. “Why should Mr. Stagg discharge
me? Why, I’m gettin’ more and more valuable to
him ev’ry day—sure I am!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
“He—he ain’t said nothin’ yet about—about a
partnership, has he, Chetwood?” his mother whispered
hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness, maw—no! You know that’ll take
time. But it’s almost sure to come. I seen him out
the other day, across the street, looking up at the
sign. And I’ll bet I know what was in his mind,
maw.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” sighed the seamstress. “But you
ain’t told us how you come to be away from the store
at this hour.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s ’cause of Car’lyn May,” responded Chet,
smiling at the little girl. “He let me off to take her
slidin’. The ice ain’t goin’ to be safe in the cove for
long now. Spring’s in the air a’ready. Both brooks
are runnin’ full.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Chet! <em>Can</em> we go sliding?” cried Carolyn
May. “I brought my sled!”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. Your uncle says he knowed you wanted
to go down on the ice. I’ll put on my skates and
draw you. We’ll have such fun!”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was delighted. Although the sky
was overcast and a storm threatening when they got
down on the ice, neither the boy nor the little girl
gave the weather a second thought. Nor had Mr.
Stagg considered the weather when he had allowed
Chet to leave the store that afternoon. He was glad
to get Chet out of the way for an hour; for, if the
truth be told, he sometimes found it difficult to make
any use of young Gormley at all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
“I might as well lock up the store when I go home
to dinner and supper,” Mr. Stagg sometimes observed
to himself. “If the critter sells anything,
it’s usually at the wrong price. He wants to sell
wire nails by the dozen and brass hinges by the
pound. I dunno what I keep him for, unless it’s for
the good of my soul. Chet Gormley does help a
feller to cultivate patience!”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, for the peace of mind of Chet and
his widowed mother, they did not suspect the hardware
dealer of holding this opinion. Just now the
boy was delighted to lend himself to Carolyn May’s
pleasure. He strapped on his skates, and then settled
the little girl firmly on her sled. She sat forward,
and he lifted Prince up behind her, where
the dog sat quite securely, with his forepaws over
his mistress’ shoulders, his jaws agape, and his
tongue hanging out like a moist, red necktie.
</p>
<p>
“He’s laughin—just as broad as he can laugh,
Car’lyn May,” chuckled Chet. “All ready, now?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’re all right, Chet,” the little girl cried
gaily.
</p>
<p>
The boy harnessed himself with the long tow-rope
and skated away from the shore, dragging the
sled after him at a brisk pace. Chet was a fine
skater, and although the surface of the ice was
rather spongy he had no difficulty in making good
time towards the mouth of the cove.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” squealed Carolyn May, “there isn’t
anybody else on the ice.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“We won’t run into nobody, then,” laughed the
boy.
</p>
<p>
There were schooners and barges and several
steam craft tied up at the docks. These had been
frozen in all winter. They would soon be free, and
lake traffic would begin again.
</p>
<p>
It was too misty outside the cove to see the open
water; but it was there, and Chet knew it as well as
anybody. He had no intention of taking any risks—especially
with Carolyn May in his charge.
</p>
<p>
The wind blew out of the cove, too. As they drew
away from the shelter of the land they felt its
strength. It was not a frosty wind. Indeed, the
temperature was rising rapidly, and, as Chet had
said, there was a hint of spring in the air.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, neither the boy nor the little girl—and
surely not the dog—looked back towards the land.
Otherwise, they would have seen the snow flurry
that swept down over the town and quickly hid it
from the cove.
</p>
<p>
Chet was skating his very swiftest. Carolyn May
was screaming with delight. Prince barked joyfully.
And, suddenly, in a startling fashion, they came to a
fissure in the ice!
</p>
<p>
The boy darted to one side, heeled on his right
skate, and stopped. He had jerked the sled aside,
too, yelling to Carolyn May to “hold fast!” But
Prince was flung from it, and scrambled over the ice,
barking loudly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Carolyn May. “You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
stopped too quick, Chet Gormley. Goodness!
There’s a hole in the ice!”
</p>
<p>
“And I didn’t see it till we was almost in it,”
acknowledged Chet. “It’s more’n a hole. Why!
there’s a great field of ice broke off and sailin’ out
into the lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped the little girl, awed, “isn’t
that great, Chet?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s great that we didn’t get caught on it,” muttered
Chet, deeply impressed by the peril.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t go any farther, can we?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Nope. Got to turn back. Why, hullo! it’s
snowin’!”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! and we didn’t bring any umbrella,”
observed Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“You call Prince. I guess we’d better get back,”
Chet said more seriously. “We’re three miles from
town, if we’re an inch.”
</p>
<p>
“And we can’t see the town or the boats or the
docks! Oh, Chet! isn’t this <em>fun</em>? I never was out
in a snowstorm on the ice before.”
</p>
<p>
The snow was damp and clung to their clothing.
Chet saw that it was going to clog his skates, too.
He would not let the child see that he was worried;
but the situation was no ordinary one.
</p>
<p>
In the first place, it was hard to tell the points of
the compass in the snowstorm. Prince might be able
to smell his way back to land; but Chet Gormley
was not endowed with the same sense of smell that
Prince possessed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
The boy knew at once that he must be careful in
making his way home with the little girl. Having
seen one great fissure in the ice, he might come upon
another. It seemed to him as though the ice under
his feet was in motion. In the distance was the
sound of a reverberating crash that could mean but
one thing. <em>The ice in the cove was breaking up!</em>
</p>
<p>
The waters of the two brooks were pouring down
into the cove. This swelling flood lifted the great
sheet of spongy ice and set it in motion. Everywhere
at the head of the cove the ice was cracking
and breaking up. The wind helped. Spring had
really come, and the annual freshet was likely now
to force the ice entirely out of the cove and open the
way for traffic in a few hours.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—THE CHAPEL BELL</h2>
<p>
If Joseph Stagg had obeyed the precept of his
little niece on this particular afternoon and had
been “looking up,” instead of having his nose
in the big ledger, making out monthly statements, he
might have discovered the coming storm in season to
withdraw his permission to Chet to take Carolyn
May out on the ice.
</p>
<p>
It was always dark enough in the little back office
in winter for the hardware dealer to have a lamp
burning. So he did not notice the snow flurry that
had taken Sunrise Cove in its arms until he chanced
to walk out to the front of the store for needed
exercise.
</p>
<p>
“I declare to man, it’s snowing!” muttered
Joseph Stagg. “Thought we’d got through with
that for this season.”
</p>
<p>
He opened the store door. There was a chill,
clammy wind, and the snow was damp and packed
quickly under foot. The street was already well
covered, and the snow stuck to the awning frames
and the fronts of the buildings across the way.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! If that Chet Gormley were here now, he
might be of some use for once,” thought Mr. Stagg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
“But, of course, he never is here when I want him.
He could clean this walk before folks get all balled
up walking on it.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he bethought him of the errand that had
taken the boy away from the store. Not at once
was the hardware merchant startled by the thought;
but he cast a critical glance skyward, trying to measure
the downfall of snow.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll be coming back—with Hannah’s Car’lyn.
Of course, he isn’t rattle-brained enough to take her
out on the ice when it’s snowing like this.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Stagg!” shouted a shopkeeper from over
the way, who had likewise come to the door, “did
you hear that?”
</p>
<p>
“Hear what?” asked Joseph Stagg, puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“There she goes again! That’s ice, old man.
She’s breaking up. We’ll have spring with us in no
time now. I told Scofield this morning he could
begin to load that schooner of his. The ice is going
out of the cove.”
</p>
<p>
The reverberating crash that had startled Chet
Gormley had startled Joseph Stagg as well.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” gasped the hardware dealer,
and he started instantly away from the store, bareheaded
as he was, without locking the door behind
him—something he had never done before, since
he had established himself in business on the main
street of Sunrise Cove.
</p>
<p>
Just why he ran he could scarcely have explained.
Of course, the children had not gone out in this snowstorm!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
Mrs. Gormley—little sense as he believed
the seamstress possessed—would not have allowed
them to venture.
</p>
<p>
Yet, why had Chet not returned? Mr. Stagg
knew very well that the ungainly boy was no shirk.
Having been sent home for the particular purpose
of taking Carolyn May out on her sled, he would
have done that, or returned immediately to the store.
Although prone to find fault with Chet Gormley,
the hardware dealer recognised his good qualities as
certainly as anybody did.
</p>
<p>
He quickened his pace. He was running—slipping
and sliding over the wet snow—when he turned
into the street on which his store boy and his widowed
mother lived.
</p>
<p>
The cottage was a little, boxlike place, and one
had to climb steps to get to it. Mrs. Gormley saw
him coming from the windows of the tiny front
room which served her as parlour and workroom
combined. The seamstress tottered to the door
and opened it wide, clinging to it for support.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh, Mr. Stagg! What’s happened now?”
she gasped. “I hope poor Chet ain’t done nothin’
that he shouldn’t ha’ done. I’m sure he tries to do
his very best. If he’s done anything——”
</p>
<p>
“Where <em>is</em> he?” Joseph Stagg managed to say.
“Where—where is he?” repeated the widow.
“Oh, do come in, Mr. Stagg. It’s snowin’, ain’t it?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg plunged into the little house, head
down, and belligerent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where’s that plagued boy?” he demanded
again. “Don’t tell me he’s taken Hannah’s Car’lyn
out on the cove in this storm!”
</p>
<p>
“But—but you <em>told</em> him he could!” wailed the
widow.
</p>
<p>
“What if I did? I didn’t know ’twas going to
snow like this, did I?”
</p>
<p>
“But it wasn’t snowin’ when they went,” said
Mrs. Gormley, plucking up some little spirit. “I’m
sure it wasn’t Chetwood’s fault. Oh, dear!”
</p>
<p>
“Woman,” groaned Joseph Stagg, “it doesn’t
matter whose fault it is—or if it’s anybody’s fault.
The mischief’s done. The ice is breaking up. It’s
drifting out of the inlet. You can hear it—if you’d
stop talking long enough.” This was rather unfair
on Mr. Stagg’s part, for he was certainly doing more
talking than anybody else.
</p>
<p>
Just at this moment an unexpected voice broke
into the discussion. There was a second woman—she
had been sitting by the window—in Mrs. Gormley’s
front room.
</p>
<p>
“Are you positive they went out on the cove to
slide, Mrs. Gormley?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I be, Mandy,” answered the seamstress.
“Chet said he was goin’ there, and what Chet says
he’ll do, he always does.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the ice has broken away and they have
been carried out into the lake,” groaned Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
Mandy Parlow came quickly to the little hall.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not, Joseph,” she said, speaking directly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
to the hardware dealer. “It may be the storm. It
snows so fast they would easily get turned around—be
unable to find the shore.”
</p>
<p>
Another reverberating crash echoed from the
cove. Mrs. Gormley wrung her hands.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my Chet! Oh, my Chet!” she wailed.
“He’ll be drowned!”
</p>
<p>
“He won’t be, if he’s got any sense,” snapped
Mr. Stagg. “I’ll get some men and we’ll go after
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Call the dog, Joseph Stagg. Call the dog,”
advised Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“Heh? Didn’t Prince go with ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, he did,” wailed Mrs. Gormley.
</p>
<p>
“Call the dog, just the same,” repeated Amanda
Parlow. “Prince will hear you and bark.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless you! So he will,” cried Mr. Stagg.
“You’ve got more sense than any of us, Mandy.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll have the chapel bell rung,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! what’s that for?”
</p>
<p>
“The wind will carry the sound out across the
cove. That boy, Chet, will recognise the sound of
the bell and it will give him an idea of where
home is.”
</p>
<p>
“You do beat all!” exclaimed Joseph Stagg,
starting to leave the house.
</p>
<p>
But Amanda stayed him for a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Find a cap of Chet’s, Mrs. Gormley,” she commanded.
“Don’t you see Mr. Stagg has no hat?
He’ll catch his death of cold.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, I never thought!” He turned to speak
directly to Miss Amanda, but she had gone back into
the room and was putting on her outer wraps. Mrs.
Gormley, red-eyed and weeping, brought the cap.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t be too hard on poor Chet, sir,”
she sobbed. “He ain’t to blame.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he isn’t,” admitted the hardware
dealer heartily. “And I’m sure he’ll look out for
Hannah’s Car’lyn—he and the dog.”
</p>
<p>
He plunged down the steps and kept on down the
hill to the waterfront. There was an eating-place
here where the waterside characters congregated,
and Mr. Stagg put his head in at the door.
</p>
<p>
“Some of you fellers come out with me on the
ice and look for a little girl—and a boy and a dog,”
said Mr. Stagg. “Like enough, they’re lost in this
storm. And the ice is going out.”
</p>
<p>
“I seen ’em when they went down,” said one man,
jumping up with alacrity. “Haven’t they come
back yet?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Snow come down and blinded ’em,” said another.
</p>
<p>
“Do you reckon the spring freshet’s re’lly due
yet?” propounded a third man.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t matter whether she be or not, Rightchild,”
growled one of the other men. “The kids
ought to be home, ’stead o’ out on that punky ice.”
</p>
<p>
They all rushed out of the eating-house and down
to the nearest dock. Even the cook went, for he
chanced to know Carolyn May.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
“And let me tell you, she’s one rare little kid,”
he declared, out of Mr. Stagg’s hearing. “How
she come to be related to that hard-as-nails Joe Stagg
is a puzzler.”
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer might deserve this title in
ordinary times, but this was one occasion when he
plainly displayed emotion.
</p>
<p>
Hannah’s Car’lyn, the little child he had learned
to love, was somewhere on the ice in the driving
storm. He would have rushed blindly out on the
rotten ice, barehanded and alone, had the others
not halted him.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on! We want a peavy or two—them’s
the best tools,” said one of the men.
</p>
<p>
“And a couple of lanterns,” said another.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg stood on the dock and shouted at
the top of his voice:
</p>
<p>
“Prince! Prince! Prince!”
</p>
<p>
The wind must have carried his voice a long way
out across the cove, but there was no reply.
</p>
<p>
Then, suddenly, the clear silver tone of a bell
rang out. Its pitch carried through the storm startlingly
clear.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! what’s the chapel bell tolling for?” demanded
the man who had suggested the lanterns.
</p>
<p>
“The boy will hear that!” cried another. “If
he isn’t an idiot, he’ll follow the sound of the chapel
bell.”
</p>
<p>
“Ya-as,” said the cook, “if the ice ain’t opened
up ’twixt him an’ the shore.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a movement out in the cove. One field
of ice crashed against another. Mr. Stagg stifled a
moan and was one of the first to climb down to the
level of the ice.
</p>
<p>
“Have a care, Joe,” somebody warned him.
“This snow on the ice will mask the holes and fissures
something scandalous.”
</p>
<p>
But Joseph Stagg was reckless of his own safety.
He started out into the snow, shouting again:
</p>
<p>
“Prince! Prince! Here, boy! Here, boy!”
</p>
<p>
There was no answering bark. The ice cracked
and shuddered and the gale slapped the snow against
the searchers more fiercely than before. Had they
been facing the wind, the snow would fairly have
blinded them.
</p>
<p>
“And that’s what’s happened to the boy,” declared
one of the men. “Don’t you see? He’s got
to face it to get back to town.”
</p>
<p>
“Then he is drifted with it,” said Mr. Stagg
hopelessly.
</p>
<p>
“Say, he’ll know which is the right way! Hear
that bell?” rejoined another. “You can hear the
chapel bell when you’re beating into the cove with the
wind dead against you. I know, for I’ve been there.”
</p>
<p>
“Me, too,” agreed another.
</p>
<p>
The clanging of the chapel bell was a comforting
sound. Joseph Stagg did not know that, unable to
find the sexton, Amanda Parlow had forced the
church door and was tugging at the rough rope
herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
Back and forth she rang the iron clapper, and it
was no uncertain note that clanged across the storm-driven
cove that afternoon. It was not work to
which Carolyn May’s “pretty lady” was used. Her
shoulders soon ached and the palms of her hands
were raw and bleeding. But she continued to toll the
bell without a moment’s surcease.
</p>
<p>
She did not know how much that resonant sound
might mean to those out on the ice—to the little girl
and the boy who might have no other means of
locating the shore, to the men who were searching
for the lost ones; for they, too, might be lost in the
storm.
</p>
<p>
The axle of the old bell groaned and shrieked at
each revolution. Miss Amanda pulled on the rope
desperately. She did not think to put her foot in
the loop of the rope to aid her in this work. With
the power of her arms and shoulders alone she
brought the music from the throat of the bell. Every
stroke was a shock that racked her body terribly.
She dared not leave the rope for a minute while she
called from the door for help.
</p>
<p>
She hoped the sexton would come, wondering who
was so steadily pulling the bell rope. Stroke followed
stroke. The axle shrieked—and she could
have done the same with pain had she not set her
teeth in her lip and put forth every atom of will
power she possessed to keep to the work and stifle
her agony.
</p>
<p>
On and on, till her brain swam, and her breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
came chokingly from her lungs. Once she missed the
stroke, her strength seeming to desert her for the
moment. Frantically she clawed at the rope again
and pulled down on it with renewed desperation.
</p>
<p>
“I will! I will!” she gasped.
</p>
<p>
Why? For the sake of the little child that she,
too, had learned to love?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps. And, yet, it was not the flowerlike face
of little Carolyn May that Amanda Parlow saw continually
before her eyes as she tugged on the bell
rope with bleeding hands.
</p>
<p>
Going out into the storm, out on the treacherous
ice, was a figure that she had watched during the long
years from behind the curtains of her front room.
It was the most familiar figure in the world to her.
</p>
<p>
She had seen it change from a youthful, willowy
shape to a solid, substantial, middle-aged figure during
these years. She had seen it aging before its
time. No wonder she could visualise it now so
plainly out there on the ice.
</p>
<p>
“Joe! Joe!” she muttered each time that she
bore down on the bell rope, and the iron tongue
shouted the word for her, far across the snow-blotted
cove.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—CHET GORMLEY’S AMBITION</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May was not the first of the trio
caught out on the moving ice to be frightened.
Perhaps because she had such unbounded
faith in the good intentions of everybody towards
her, the child could not imagine anything really hurting
her.
</p>
<p>
That is, excepting wildcats. Carolyn May was
pretty well convinced that they did not like little
girls.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, isn’t this fun!” she crowed, bending her
head before the beating of the storm. “Do hang
on, Princey.”
</p>
<p>
But Prince could not hang on so well, now that
they faced the wind. He slipped off the sled twice,
and that delayed them. Under his skates, Chet could
feel the ice heave, while the resonant cracks followed
each other like a file-fire of musketry.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” gasped Carolyn May, “the ice
seems to be going all to pieces, Chet. I hope it
won’t till we get back to the shore.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m hopin’ that, too,” returned the boy.
</p>
<p>
He had quickly realised that they were in peril,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
but he would not let Carolyn May see that he was
frightened—no, indeed! But he had to give up trying
to make Prince sit on the sled.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll just have to run. He can do it in this
snow,” said Chet. “I declare! he can get along
better than I can. I guess I’d better take off my
skates.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll hold ’em for you, Chet,” Carolyn May cried,
laughing. “My! doesn’t this snow slap you hard?”
</p>
<p>
The boy unstrapped the skates swiftly. He had
a very good reason for removing them. If the ice
was breaking up into floes, he might skate right off
into the water, being unable to halt quickly enough,
if on the steel runners.
</p>
<p>
He now plodded on, head down, dragging the sled
and the child, with Prince slipping and scratching
along beside them.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he came to open water. It was so broad
a channel that he could not hope to leap it; and, of
course, he could not get the sled and the little girl
across.
</p>
<p>
“My!” cried Carolyn May, “that place wasn’t
here when we came out, was it, Chet? It must have
just come here.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it was here before,” admitted the
boy.
</p>
<p>
“Or maybe you’re not going back the way you
came?” suggested the little girl. “Are you sure
you’re going the right way home?”
</p>
<p>
Chet really was doubtful of his direction. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
believed that the wind was blowing directly down
the cove, but it might have shifted. The thickly falling
snow blinded and confused him.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a sound reached their ears that startled
both; it even made Prince prick up his ears and listen.
Then the dog sat up on his haunches and began to
howl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>don’t</em>, Prince!” gasped Carolyn May.
“Who ever told you you could sing, just because you
hear a church bell ringing?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the chapel bell!” cried Chet Gormley.
“Now I’m sure I’m right. But we must get around
this open patch of water.”
</p>
<p>
He set off along the edge of the open water, which
looked black and angry. The ice groaned and
cracked in a threatening way. He was not sure
whether the floe they were on had completely broken
away from the great mass of ice in the cove and
was already drifting out into the lake or not.
</p>
<p>
Haste, however, he knew was imperative. The
tolling of the chapel bell coming faintly down the
wind, Chet drew the sled swiftly along the edge of
the opening, the dog trotting along beside them,
whining. Prince plainly did not approve of this.
</p>
<p>
“Here it is!” shouted the boy in sudden joy.
“Now we’ll be all right, Car’lyn May!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad, Chet,” said the little girl.
“For I’m getting real cold, and this snow makes me
all wet.”
</p>
<p>
Chet was tempted to take off his coat and put it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
about her. But the coat was thin, and he felt that
it was already soaked through. It would not do her
any material good.
</p>
<p>
“Keep up your heart, Car’lyn May,” he begged.
“I guess we’ll get through all right now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m not really afraid,” the little girl
answered. “Only I’d really like to be on shore.”
</p>
<p>
Chet would have liked to be on shore at that very
moment himself. He swiftly drew the sled around
the upper end of the open piece of water. The ice
was “bucking” under his feet, and scarcely had they
got away from the water when the crack extended
clear across the cove and the floe drifted away.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” shouted the boy, his courage rising
again. “We’re well rid of that old place.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, isn’t it good that we got away from there?”
Carolyn May remarked. “Why! we might have
drifted right out into the middle of the lake and been
home too late for supper.”
</p>
<p>
Chet had no rejoinder to make to this. He realised
that the entire surface of the cove ice was
breaking up. Again and again the shattering sounds
announced the splitting of the ice floes. He hastened
on towards the sound of the tolling bell, sharply on
the watch for other breaks in the ice.
</p>
<p>
Here was another—a wide-spreading crevasse
filled with black water. Chet had no idea to which
direction he should turn. And, indeed, it seemed
to him as though the opening was growing wider
each moment. The ice on which they stood must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
be completely severed from that further up in the
inlet!
</p>
<p>
The boy had become frightened. Carolyn May
had little idea of their danger. Prince sat up and
howled. It seemed to the boy as though they were
in desperate straits, indeed.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to be a brave girl, Car’lyn May,” he
said. “I’m goin’ to swim across this place and
then drag you over. You stick to the sled and you
won’t scarcely get wet even.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Chet! but <em>you’ll</em> get wet!” she cried.
“And your mother’ll punish you, Chet Gormley!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, she won’t,” replied the boy, with a hysterical
laugh. “Don’t you fear. Now, sit right
still.”
</p>
<p>
He had untied one end of the sled rope and looped
it around his wrist. The open water was not more
than eight feet across. He knew it was going to be
an exceedingly cold plunge, but he saw no other way
of overcoming the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Prince began to bark madly when the boy sat
down and thrust his legs into the black water. The
chill of it almost took Chet’s breath away when he
finally slid down, shoulder deep, into the flood.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Chet! don’t you <em>dare</em> get drownd-ed!”
begged Carolyn May, terrified now by the situation.
</p>
<p>
He turned a bright face on her as he struck out
for the edge of the other ice floe. Chet might not
have been the wisest boy who ever lived, but he was
brave, in the very best sense of the word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about me, Car’lyn May,” he chattered.
</p>
<p>
The desperate chill of the water almost stopped
the boy’s heart. The shock of this plunge into the icy
depths was sufficient to kill a weak person. But Chet
Gormley had plenty of reserve strength, whether he
was noted for good sense or not.
</p>
<p>
Almost anybody in his situation would have remained
on the ice and hoped for help from shore;
but it never entered Chet’s mind that he could expect
anybody else to save Carolyn May but himself.
She was in his care, and Chet believed it was up to
him to get her safely ashore, and that in as quick
time as possible.
</p>
<p>
Three strokes took him across the patch of open
water. He hooked his arms over the edge of the
ice to his elbows, took breath for a moment, and then
dragged his long frame up on the bobbing, uncertain
field.
</p>
<p>
It was a mighty struggle. Chet’s saturated garments
and his boots filled with water weighed him
down like lead. But he accomplished it at last. He
was safely on the ice. He glanced back over his
shoulder and saw the child on the sled in the snowstorm
and the dog beside her.
</p>
<p>
“Well be all right in a minute, Car’lyn May!”
he called, climbing to his feet.
</p>
<p>
And then he discovered something that almost
stunned him. The line he had looped around his
wrist had slipped off! He had no way of reaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
the rope attached to the sled save by crossing back
through the water.
</p>
<p>
Chet felt that he could not do it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Chet! Chet!” wailed Carolyn May,
“you’ve dropped my rope!”
</p>
<p>
The end of it hung in the water. The child, of
course, could not throw it across to him. The boy
was stricken dumb and motionless. That is, he was
motionless, save for the trembling of his limbs and
the chattering of his teeth. The chill of the water
had struck through, it seemed, to the very marrow
of his bones.
</p>
<p>
What he should do, poor Chet could not think.
His brain seemed completely clouded. And he was
so cold and helpless that there was not much he
could do, anyway.
</p>
<p>
His clothing was stiffening on his frame. The
snow beat against his back, and he could scarcely
stand. The space was growing wider between the
edge of the ice where he stood and that edge where
Carolyn May and the dog were.
</p>
<p>
But what was the little girl doing? He saw her
hauling in on the wet rope, and she seemed to be
speaking to Prince, for he stood directly before her,
his ears erect, his tail agitated. By-and-by he barked
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Now</em>, Princey!” Chet heard her cry.
</p>
<p>
She thrust the end of the rope into the dog’s jaws
and waved her mittened hand towards the open
water and the unhappy Chet beyond it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
Prince sprang around, faced the strait of black
water, shaking the end of the rope vigorously. Chet
saw what she meant, and he shrieked to the dog:
</p>
<p>
“Come on, Prince! Come on, good dog! Here,
sir!”
</p>
<p>
Prince could not bark his reply with the rope in
his jaws, but he sprang into the water, and swam
sturdily towards Chet.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, you good dog!” yelled Chet, half-crying
and half-laughing. “You have the pep, you
have, Prince! Come on!”
</p>
<p>
He stooped and seized the dog’s forelegs when
he came near and helped him scramble out on the
ice. The end of the rope was safely in his grasp
again.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! My goodness! I could sing a
hallelujah!” declared Chet, his eyes streaming now.
“Hold on, now, Car’lyn May! I’m goin’ to drag
you across. You hang right on to that sled.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll cling to it, Chet,” declared the little
girl. “And do take me off this ice, quick, for I think
it’s floating out with me.”
</p>
<p>
Chet drew on the rope, the sled moved forward
and plunged, with just a little splash, into the pool.
Prince barked desperately as his little mistress
screamed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m getting wet, Chet!” she shrieked.
</p>
<p>
“Hold hard!” yelled Chet in return. “You
won’t get very wet.”
</p>
<p>
In a few seconds he had “snaked” the sled to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
the edge of the ice floe on which he stood. He picked
the sobbing Carolyn May off the sled and then lifted
that up, too. The little girl was wet below her waist.
</p>
<p>
“I’m—I’m just as co—cold as I—I can be,” she
chattered. “Oh, Chet! take me home please!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m a-going to,” chattered the lad in return.
</p>
<p>
He dragged off his coat now, wrung it as dry as
he could, and wrapped it around Carolyn May’s legs
before he seated her on the sled again. Then he
seized the rope once more and started towards the
sound of the chapel bell.
</p>
<p>
How glad he was that the bell still sounded! He
was sure of that—and it was the only thing he was
sure of.
</p>
<p>
He could only stagger on, now, for his feet were
very heavy, and he felt as though he should fall at
any moment. And if he did fall he was quite sure
he would not be able to get up again.
</p>
<p>
Chet knew he could not face Mr. Stagg if anything
really bad happened to “Hannah’s Car’lyn.” All
his hopes of advancement and ultimate success would
be swept away, too, if this adventure ended in
tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Foolish as perhaps the boy’s longings and hopes
were, the mark he had set himself to gain was very
real, indeed, to Chet Gormley. He hoped some day
to see that sign, “Stagg &amp; Gormley,” over the hardware
store door. If for no other reason than that,
he would not give up now.
</p>
<p>
The chapel bell tolled on. The sleet beat in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
face stingingly. He panted and staggered, but persevered.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll show him,” murmured Chet. “I won’t
give up! Poor little kid—I guess <em>not</em>! I’ll get her
home——”
</p>
<p>
Prince began to bark. He could not move forward
much faster than Chet did; but he faced to the
right and began to bark with persistence.
</p>
<p>
“There—there’s something over there, Chet,”
murmured Carolyn May. She was all but breathless
herself.
</p>
<p>
Then, through the wind and the storm, came a
faint hail. Prince eagerly pursued his barking.
Chet tried to reply to the hail, but his voice was
only a hoarse croak.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to keep on—we’ve got to keep on,”
muttered the lad, dragging the sled slowly.
</p>
<p>
His submersion in the icy water had been a serious
matter. His limbs were too heavy, it seemed, for
further progress. He scarcely knew now what he
was doing—only the tolling of the chapel bell seemed
to draw him on—and on—and on——
</p>
<p>
The dog had disappeared. Carolyn May was
weeping frankly. Chet Gormley was pushing slowly
through the storm, staggering at each step, scarcely
aware in what direction he was heading.

<p>
Joseph Stagg heard the dog barking first of
all. Rightchild and the cook were directly behind
him, and when the hardware dealer bore
suddenly off to the right they shouted after him.
</p>
<p>
“If the ice is breaking up, Joe, that’s where she’ll
give way first—in the middle of the cove,” Rightchild
said.
</p>
<p>
“And the boy wouldn’t know any better than to
come right up the middle,” Mr. Stagg declared.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right,” agreed the cook.
</p>
<p>
“Besides, there’s the dog. Listen!”
</p>
<p>
Prince’s barking was unmistakable now. The
other men realised what the sound must mean. It
was as convincing as the chapel bell; and that kept
on as steadily as a clock pendulum.
</p>
<p>
The men with Mr. Stagg having spread out on
the ice like a skirmishing party, now closed in towards
the point from which sounded the dog’s barking.
The hardware dealer shouted as he ran. He
was the most reckless of them all, and on several
occasions came near to falling. The snow over the
ice made the footing treacherous, indeed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly an object appeared in the smother of
falling snow. Hoarsely the dog barked again. Mr.
Stagg shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Hey, Prince! Prince! Here we are!”
</p>
<p>
The mongrel made for the hardware merchant
and almost knocked him over. He was mad with
joy. He barked and whined and leaped upon the
man; and the sight of Joseph Stagg down on his
knees in the snow trying to hug the wriggling dog
was certainly one to startle his neighbours.
</p>
<p>
“Show ’em to us, good dog!” cried Uncle Joe.
“Take us to ’em! Where’s Hannah’s Car’lyn?
Show us, boy!”
</p>
<p>
“That dog’s a good un,” declared Rightchild.
</p>
<p>
“Now you’ve said something,” agreed the eating-house
cook.
</p>
<p>
Prince lapped Mr. Stagg’s face and then ran off
through the falling snow, barking and leaping. The
men hurried after him. Twice or thrice the dog
was back, to make sure that he was followed. Then
the men saw something outlined in the driving
snow.
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Joe! Uncle Joe!”
</p>
<p>
The child’s shrill voice reached the hardware
merchant. There was poor Chet, staggering on,
leaning against the wind, and pulling the sled behind
him.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you silly chump!” growled Joseph Stagg.
“Where’re you going, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe!” wailed Carolyn May, “he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
isn’t anything like that, at all! He’s just the very
bravest boy! And he’s all wet and cold.”
</p>
<p>
At the conclusion of this declaration poor Chet
fell to his knees, and then slipped quietly forward
on his face.
</p>
<p>
“I vum!” grunted the hardware dealer, “I guess
the boy is all in.”
</p>
<p>
But Chet did not lose consciousness. He raised
a faint murmur which reached Mr. Stagg’s ears.
</p>
<p>
“I—I did the best I could, Mr. Stagg. Take—take
her right up to mother. She’ll fix Car’lyn up,
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, kid!” exclaimed the cook, “I guess you
need a bit of fixin’ up yourself. Why, see here,
boys, this chap’s been in the water and his clothes
is froze stiff.”
</p>
<p>
“Pick him up and put him on the sled here, boys,”
Mr. Stagg said. “I’ll carry Hannah’s Car’lyn myself.”
</p>
<p>
The party, including the excited Prince, got back
to the docks without losing any time and without
further accident. Still the chapel bell was ringing,
and somebody said:
</p>
<p>
“We’d have been up a stump for knowing the
direction, if it hadn’t been for that bell.”
</p>
<p>
“Me, too,” muttered Chet Gormley. “That’s
what kep’ me goin’, folks—the chapel bell. It just
seemed to be callin’ me home.”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg carried his niece up to Mrs. Gormley’s
little house, while Rightchild helped Chet along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
to the same destination. The seamstress met them
at the door, wildly excited.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you think?” she cried. “They
took Mandy Parlow home in Tim’s hack. She was
just done up, they tell me, pullin’ that chapel bell.
Did you ever hear of such a silly critter—just because
she couldn’t find the sexton!”
</p>
<p>
“Hum! you and I both seem to be mistaken about
what constitutes silliness, Mrs. Gormley,” grumbled
the hardware dealer. “I was for calling your Chet
silly, till I learned what he’d done. And you’d better
not call Miss Mandy silly. The sound of the
chapel bell gave us all our bearings. Both of ’em,
Chet and Miss Mandy, did their best.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was taken home in Tim’s hack, too.
To her surprise, Tim was ordered to stop at the
Parlow house and go in to ask how Miss Amanda
was.
</p>
<p>
By this time the story of her pulling of the chapel-bell
rope was all over Sunrise Cove, and the hack
driver was, naturally, as curious as anybody. So he
willingly went into the Parlow cottage, bringing back
word that she was resting comfortably, Dr. Nugent
having just left her.
</p>
<p>
“An’ she’s one brave gal,” declared Tim.
“Pitcher of George Washington! pullin’ that bell
rope ain’t no baby’s job.”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May did not altogether understand what
Miss Amanda had done, but she was greatly pleased
that Uncle Joe had so plainly displayed his interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
in the carpenter’s daughter. On this particular occasion,
however, she was so sleepy that she was lifted
out of the hack when they reached home by Uncle
Joe, who carried her into the house in his arms.
</p>
<p>
When Aunty Rose heard the outline of the story
she bustled about at once to get the little girl to bed.
She sat up in bed and had her supper, with Prince
sitting close beside her on the floor and Aunty Rose
watching her as though she felt that something of
an exciting nature might happen at any moment to
the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“I never did see such a child—I never did!”
Aunty Rose repeated.
</p>
<p>
The next morning Carolyn May seemed to be in
good condition. Indeed, she was the only individual
vitally interested in the adventure who did not pay
for the exposure. Even Prince had barked his legs
being hauled out on to the ice. Uncle Joe had caught
a bad cold in his head and suffered from it for some
time. Miss Amanda remained in bed for several
days. But it was poor Chet Gormley who paid the
dearest price for participation in the exciting incident.
Dr. Nugent had hard work fighting off pneumonia.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg surprised himself by the interest he
took in Chet. He closed his store twice each day
to call at the Widow Gormley’s house. The seamstress
was so delighted with this attention on the
hardware merchant’s part that she was willing to
accept at its face value Chet’s hope and expectation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
that <em>some</em> day the sign over the store door would
read, “Stagg &amp; Gormley.”
</p>
<p>
It was a fact that Mr. Stagg found himself talking
with Chet more than he ever had before. The
boy was lonely, and the man found a spark of interest
in his heart for him that he had never previously discovered.
He began to probe into his young employee’s
thoughts, to learn something of his outlook
on life; perhaps, even, he got some inkling of Chet’s
ambition.
</p>
<p>
That week the ice went entirely out of the cove.
Spring was at hand, with its muddy roads, blue skies,
sweeter airs, soft rains, and a general revivifying
feeling.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose declared that Carolyn May began at
once to “perk up.” Perhaps the cold, long winter
had been hard for the child to bear. At least, being
able to run out of doors without stopping to bundle
up was a delight.
</p>
<p>
One day the little girl had a more than ordinarily
hard school task to perform. Everything did not
come easy to Carolyn May, “by any manner of
means,” as Aunty Rose would have said. Composition
writing was her bane, and Miss Minnie had
instructed all Carolyn May’s class to bring in a written
exercise the next morning. The little girl wandered
over to the churchyard with her slate and
pencil—and Prince, of course—to try to achieve the
composition.
</p>
<p>
The earth was dry and warm and the grass was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
springing freshly. A soft wind blew from the south
and brought with it the scent of growing things.
</p>
<p>
The windows of the minister’s study overlooked
this spot, and he was sitting at his desk while Carolyn
May was laboriously writing the words on her slate
(having learned to use a slate) which she expected
later to copy into her composition book.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Afton Driggs watched her puzzled
face and labouring fingers for some moments before
calling out of the window to her. Several sheets of
sermon paper lay before him on the desk, and perhaps
he was having almost as hard a time putting on
the paper what he desired to say as Carolyn May
was having with her writing.
</p>
<p>
Finally, he came to the window and spoke to her.
</p>
<p>
“Carolyn May,” he said, “what are you
writing?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Driggs, is that you?” said the little
girl, getting up quickly and coming nearer. “Did
you ever have to write a composition?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Carolyn May, I have to write one or two
each week.” And he sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes! So you do!” the little girl agreed.
“You have to write sermons. And that must be a
terribly tedious thing to do, for they have to be
longer than my composition—a great deal longer.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is a composition that is troubling you,” the
minister remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. I don’t know what to write—I really
don’t. Miss Minnie says for us not to try any flights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
of fancy. I don’t just know what those are. But
she says, write what is in us. Now, <em>that</em> don’t seem
like a composition,” added Carolyn May doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“What doesn’t?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, writing what is in us,” explained the little
girl, staring in a puzzled fashion at her slate, on
which she had written several lines. “You see, I
have written down all the things that I ’member is
in me.”
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake! let me see it, child,” said the
minister, quickly reaching down for the slate. When
he brought it to a level with his eyes he was amazed
by the following:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“In me there is my heart, my liver, my lungs, my
verform pendicks, my stummick, two ginger cookies,
a piece of pepmint candy, and my dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” Mr. Driggs shut off this
explosion by a sudden cough.
</p>
<p>
“I guess it isn’t much of a composition, Mr.
Driggs,” Carolyn May said frankly. “But how
can you make your inwards be pleasant reading?”
</p>
<p>
The minister was having no little difficulty in restraining
his mirth.
</p>
<p>
“Go around to the door, Carolyn May, and ask
Mrs. Driggs to let you in. Perhaps I can help you
in this composition writing.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>will</em> you, Mr. Driggs?” cried the little girl.
“That is awful kind of you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
The minister must have confided in his wife before
she came to the door to let Carolyn May in, for she
was laughing heartily.
</p>
<p>
“You funny little thing!” cried Mrs. Driggs,
catching her up in her arms. “Mr. Driggs says he
is waiting for you—and this sermon day, too! Go
into his study.”
</p>
<p>
The clergyman did not seem to mind neglecting
his task for the pleasure of helping Carolyn May
with hers. Be explained quite clearly just what Miss
Minnie meant by “writing what is in you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! It’s what you think about a thing yourself—not
what other folks think,” cried Carolyn
May. “Why, I can do that. I thought it was something
like those physerology lessons. Then I can
write about anything I want to, can’t I?”
</p>
<p>
“I think so,” replied the minister.
</p>
<p>
“I’m awfully obliged to you, Mr. Driggs,” the
little girl said. “I wish I might do something for
you in return.”
</p>
<p>
“Help me with my sermon, perhaps?” he asked,
smiling.
</p>
<p>
“I would if I could, Mr. Driggs.” Carolyn May
was very earnest.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, Carolyn May, how would you go
about writing a sermon, if you had one to write?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mr. Driggs!” exclaimed the little girl,
clasping her hands. “I know just how I’d do it.”
</p>
<p>
“You do? Tell me how, then, my dear,” he
returned, smiling. “Perhaps you have an inspiration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
for writing sermons that I have never yet
found.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mr. Driggs, I’d try to write every word
so’s to make folks that heard it happier. That’s
what I’d do. I’d make ’em <em>look up</em> and see the sunshine
and the sky—and the mountains, ’way off yonder—so
they’d see nothing but bright things and
breathe only good air and hear birds sing—Oh,
dear me, <em>that</em>—that is the way I’d write a sermon.”
</p>
<p>
The clergyman’s face had grown grave as he
listened to her, but he kissed her warmly as he
thanked her and bade her good-bye. When she had
gone from the study he read again the text written
at the top of the first sheet of sermon paper. It was
taken from the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
</p>
<p>
“‘To write every word so’s to make folks that
heard it happier,’” he murmured as he crumpled the
sheet of paper in his hand and dropped it in the
waste-basket.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—THE AWAKENING</h2>
<p>
With the opening of spring and the close of
the sledding season, work had stopped at
Adams’ camp. Rather, the entire plant
had been shipped twenty miles deeper into the forest—mill,
bunk-house, cook-shed, and such corrugated-iron
shacks as were worth carting away.
</p>
<p>
All that was left on the site of the busy camp were
huge heaps of sawdust, piles of slabs, discarded timbers,
and the half-burned bricks into which had been
built the portable boiler and engine.
</p>
<p>
And old Judy Mason. She was not considered
worth moving to the new site of the camp. She was
bedridden with rheumatism. This was the report
Tim, the hackman, had brought in.
</p>
<p>
The old woman’s husband had gone with the outfit
to the new camp, for he could not afford to give
up his work. Judy had not been so bad when the
camp was broken up, but when Tim went over for a
load of slabs for summer firewood, he discovered her
quite helpless in her bunk and almost starving. The
rheumatic attack had become serious.
</p>
<p>
Amanda Parlow had at once ridden over with Dr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
Nugent. Then she had come home for her bag and
had insisted on the carpenter’s driving her back to
the abandoned camp, proposing to stay with Judy
till the old woman was better.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose had one comment to make upon it,
and Carolyn May another. Mr. Stagg’s housekeeper
said:
</p>
<p>
“That is just like a parcel of men folks—leaving
an old woman to look out for herself. Disgraceful!
And Amanda Parlow will not even be thanked for
what she does.”
</p>
<p>
“How brave and helpful it is of Miss Amanda!”
Carolyn May cried. “Dear me, when I grow up, I
hope I can be a gradjerate nurse like Miss Mandy.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon that’s some spell ahead,” chuckled Mr.
Parlow, to whom she said this when he picked her
up for a drive after taking his daughter to the camp.
</p>
<p>
“And you’ll come nigh to wantin’ to be a dozen
other things ’fore you’re old enough to go to work
in a hospital, I shouldn’t wonder. Gid-ap, Cherry!”
</p>
<p>
Cherry tossed his head and increased his stride.
The carpenter had one weakness—that was horseflesh.
He was always the owner of a roadster of
note.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a funny name for a horse, Mr. Parlow,”
observed Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Cherry red. That’s his colour.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“And I got a cat home that’s cherry colour, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Why-e-e-e!” exclaimed the little girl, “I’m sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
I never saw that one, Mr. Parlow. Your cat is
black—all black.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” chuckled the old man over the ancient
joke, “he’s the colour of a blackheart cherry.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! I never thought of that,” giggled
Carolyn May. She looked up into his hard, dry
face with an expression of perplexity in her own.
“Mr. Parlow,” she went on seriously, “don’t you
think <em>now</em> that Miss Amanda ought to be happy?”
</p>
<p>
“Happy!” exclaimed the carpenter, startled.
“What about, child?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, about everything. You know, once I
asked you about her being happy, and—and you
didn’t seem fav’rable. You said ‘Bah!’”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May’s imitation of that explosive word
as previously used by Mr. Parlow was absolutely
funny; but the carpenter only looked at her sidewise,
and his face remained grim.
</p>
<p>
“So I said ‘Bah,’ did I?” he grunted. “And
what makes you think I might not say it now?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” explained Carolyn May earnestly, “I
hoped you’d come to see things like—like I do. You
are lots pleasanter than you used to be, Mr. Parlow—indeed,
you are. You are happier yourself.”
</p>
<p>
The old man made no reply for a minute, and
Carolyn May had the patience to wait for her suggestion
to “sink in.” Finally, he said:
</p>
<p>
“I dunno but you’re right, Car’lyn May. Not
that it matters much, I guess, whether a body’s
happy or not in this world,” he added grudgingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, it does, Mr. Parlow! It matters a
great deal, I am sure—to us and to other people.
If we’re not happy <em>inside</em> of us, how can we be cheerful
<em>outside</em>, and so make other people happy? And
that is what I mean about Miss Amanda.”
</p>
<p>
“What about Mandy?”
</p>
<p>
“She isn’t happy,” sighed Carolyn May. “Not
really. She’s just as good as good can be. She is
always doing for folks, and helping. But she can’t
be real happy.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” growled Mr. Parlow, his face
turned away.
</p>
<p>
“Why—’cause—Well, you <em>know</em>, Mr. Parlow,
she can’t be happy as long as she and my Uncle Joe
are mad at each other.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow uttered another grunt, but the child
went bravely on.
</p>
<p>
“You know very well that’s so. And I don’t
know what to do about it. It just seems too awful
that they should hardly speak, and yet be so fond
of each other deep down.”
</p>
<p>
“How d’you know they’re so fond of each other—deep
down?” Mr. Parlow demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I know my Uncle Joe likes Miss Mandy, ’cause
he always speaks so—so respectful of her. And I
can see she likes him, in her eyes,” replied the observant
Carolyn May. “Oh, yes, Mr. Parlow, they
ought to be happy again, and we ought to make
’em so.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! Who ought to?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p>
“You and me. We ought to find some way of
doing it. I’m sure we can, if we just think hard
about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted the carpenter again, turning
Cherry into the dooryard. “Huh!”
</p>
<p>
This was not a very encouraging response. Yet
he did think of it. The little girl had started a train
of thought in Mr. Parlow’s mind that he could not
sidetrack.
</p>
<p>
He knew very well that what she had said about
his daughter and Joseph Stagg was quite true. In
his selfishness he had been glad all these years that
the hardware merchant was balked of happiness.
As for his daughter’s feelings, Mr. Parlow had put
them aside as “women’s foolishness.” He had never
much considered women in his life.
</p>
<p>
The carpenter had always been a self-centred individual,
desirous of his own comfort, and rather
miserly. He had not approved, in the first place, of
the intimacy between Joseph Stagg and his daughter Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“No good’ll come o’ <em>that</em>,” he had told himself.
</p>
<p>
That is, no good to Jedidiah Parlow. He foresaw
at the start the loss of the girl’s help about the
house, for his wife was then a helpless invalid.
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. Parlow died. This death made plainer
still to the carpenter that Mandy’s marriage was
bound to bring inconvenience to him. Especially if
she married a close-fisted young business man like Joe
Stagg would this be true. For, at the reading of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
wife’s will, Mr. Parlow discovered that the property
they occupied, even the shop in which he worked,
which had been given to Mrs. Parlow by her parents,
was to be the sole property of her daughter. Mandy
was the heir. Mr. Parlow did not possess even a
life interest in the estate.
</p>
<p>
It was a blow to the carpenter. He made a good
income and had money in bank, but he loved money
too well to wish to spend it after he had made it.
He did not want to give up the place. If Mandy
remained unmarried there would never be any question
between them of rent or the like.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if he was not actually the cause of the
difference that arose between the two young people,
he seized and enlarged upon it and did all in his
power to make a mere misunderstanding grow into
a quarrel that neither of the proud, high-spirited
lovers would bridge.
</p>
<p>
Jedidiah Parlow knew why Joe Stagg had taken
that other girl to Faith Camp Meeting. The young
man had stopped at the Parlow place when Amanda
was absent and explained to the girl’s father. But
the latter had never mentioned this fact to his
daughter.
</p>
<p>
Instead, he had made Joe’s supposed offense the
greater by suggestion and innuendo. And it was he,
too, who had urged the hurt Mandy to retaliate by
going to the dance with another young man. Meeting
Joe Stagg later, the carpenter had said bitter
things to him, purporting to come from Mandy. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
was all mean and vile; the old man knew it now—as
he had known it then.
</p>
<p>
All these years he had tried to add fuel to the fire
of his daughter’s anger against Joe Stagg. And he
believed he had benefited thereby. But, somehow,
during the past few months, he had begun to wonder
if, after all, “the game was worth the candle.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he had gained a vision of what Amanda
Parlow’s empty life meant to her. And it was empty,
he knew—empty of that love which every woman
craves; empty of the greatest thing that can come
into her life.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Parlow had realised what had been denied his
daughter when he had first seen Carolyn May in
Mandy’s arms. That was the thing lacking. The
love of children, the right to care for children of her
own. He had been practically the cause of this
denial. Sometimes, when he thought of it, the carpenter
was rather shaken. Suppose he should be
called to account for his daughter’s loss?
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May, interested only in seeing her friends
made happy, had no idea of the turmoil she had created
in Mr. Parlow’s mind. She went her way as
usual, scattering sunshine, and hiding as much as she
could the trouble that gnawed in her own heart.
</p>
<p>
The love of Uncle Joe and Aunty Rose and Miss
Amanda and Mr. Driggs and the host of her other
friends at The Corners and in Sunrise Cove could
not take the place in faithful little Carolyn May’s
heart of that parental affection which had been so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
lavished on her all the days of her life, until the
sailing of the <em>Dunraven</em>.
</p>
<p>
Had the little girl possessed brothers and sisters,
it might have been different. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron
could not, in that case, have devoted themselves
so entirely to the little girl.
</p>
<p>
She had been her mother’s close companion and
her father’s chum. True, it had made her “old-fashioned”—old
in speech and in her attitude towards
many things in life, but she was none the less
charming because of this difference between her and
other children.
</p>
<p>
Her upbringing had indeed made her what she
was. She thought more deeply than other children
of her age. Her nature was the logical outgrowth
of such training as she had received from associating
with older people.
</p>
<p>
She was seriously desirous of seeing Uncle Joe and
Miss Amanda made happy in their love for each
other. She was a born matchmaker—there was no
doubt of that.
</p>
<p>
During the time that the nurse was at the abandoned
lumber camp caring for Judy Mason, Carolyn
May hoped that something might take Uncle Joe
there. She even tried to get him to drive her over
to see Miss Amanda on Sunday afternoon. But
Uncle Joe did not keep a horse himself, and he
would not be coaxed into hiring one for any such
excursion.
</p>
<p>
“Besides, what would your Aunty Rose say?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
he asked his little niece. “She would not approve
of our doing such a thing on the Lord’s Day, I am
sure.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, he was as eager as a boy to do it.
It was because he shrank from having the neighbours
comment on his doing the very thing he desired to do
that he so sternly refused to consider Carolyn May’s
suggestion. Those neighbours might think that he
was deliberately going to call on Miss Amanda!
</p>
<p>
The next Friday, after school was out, Miss
Amanda appeared at the Stagg home and suggested
taking Carolyn May into the woods with her, “for
the week-end,” as she laughingly said. Tim, the
hackman, had brought the nurse home for a few
hours and would take her back to Judy’s cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Poor old Judy is much better, but she is still
suffering and cannot be left alone for long,” Miss
Amanda said. “Carolyn May will cheer her up.”
</p>
<p>
Delighted, Carolyn May ran to get ready. Spring
was far advanced and the woods were very beautiful.
And to stay all night—two whole nights—in a log
cabin seemed wonderfully attractive to the little girl.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose let her go because she knew that
Uncle Joe would approve of it. Indeed, they had
talked the matter over already. Carolyn May
missed Miss Amanda so that the hardware dealer
had already agreed to some such arrangement as this.
Mr. Parlow would drive over on Sunday afternoon
and bring the little girl home. Of course, Prince
had to go along.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
</p>
<p>
That Friday evening at supper matters in the big
kitchen of the Stagg house were really at a serious
pass. Joseph Stagg sat down to the table visibly
without appetite. Aunty Rose drank one cup of tea
after another without putting a crumb between her
lips.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you to-night, Joseph
Stagg?” his housekeeper finally demanded. “Aren’t
the victuals good enough for you?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Mr. Stagg drily, “I think they’re
poisoned. You don’t expect me to eat if you don’t
set an example, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“What I do has nothing to do with you, Joseph
Stagg,” said Mrs. Kennedy, bridling. “I’m pecking
and tasting at victuals all day long. I get so I
despise ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” returned Mr. Stagg. “And if Hannah’s
Car’lyn don’t come back, I shall get to despise ’em,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” ejaculated the old lady. “You do miss
the little thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss her? Bless me! I wouldn’t believe it
made so much difference having her about. It’s
knowing she really is away, and is going to be gone
for a couple of days, that’s the matter, I s’pose.
Say, Aunty Rose!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Joseph Stagg?”
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun did we do before Hannah’s
Car’lyn came here, anyway? Seems to me we didn’t
really live, did we?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose had no answer to make to these questions.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe missed kissing the little girl good-night.
He even missed the rattle of Prince’s chain at the
dog-house when he came back from the store late in
the evening.
</p>
<p>
The air had grown heavy and close, and he stood
on the porch for a minute and snuffed knowingly at
the odour a good deal as the dog might.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a fire over the mountain, I guess,” he
said to Aunty Rose when he entered the house.
“We’re having a dry spring.”
</p>
<p>
They went to bed. In the morning there was a
smoky fog over everything—a fog that the sun did
not dissipate, and behind which it looked like an
enormous saffron ball.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg went down to the store as usual. On
the way he passed the Parlow place, and he saw the
carpenter in his shop door. Parlow was gazing with
seeming anxiety into the fog cloud, his face turned
towards the forest. Joseph Stagg did not know that,
in all the years of their estrangement, the carpenter
had never been so near speaking to the hardware
dealer.
</p>
<p>
The smoky tang in the air was as strong in Sunrise
Cove as out in the country. The shopkeepers were
talking about the fire. News had come over the
long-distance wires that thousands of acres of woodland
were burning, that the forest reserves were out,
and that the farmers of an entire township on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
far side of the mountain were engaged in trying to
make a barrier over which the flames would not leap.
It was the consensus of opinion, however, that the
fire would not cross the range. It never had on
former occasions, and the wind was against such an
advance. The top of the ridge was covered with
boulders and the vegetation was scant.
</p>
<p>
“Scarcely any chance of its swooping down on
us,” decided Mr. Stagg. “Reckon I won’t have to
go home to plough fire furrows.”
</p>
<p>
At the usual hour he started for The Corners for
dinner. Having remained in the store all the morning,
he had not realised how much stronger the smell
of smoke was than it had been at breakfast time.
Quite involuntarily he quickened his pace.
</p>
<p>
The fog and smoke overcast the sky thickly and
made it of a brassy colour, just as though a huge
copper pot had been overturned over the earth.
Women stood at their doors, talking back and forth
together in low tones. There was a spirit of expectancy
in the air. Every person he saw was
affected by it.
</p>
<p>
There seemed scarcely any danger of a forest fire
sweeping in upon Sunrise Cove, or even upon The
Corners. There was too much cleared land surrounding
the town. But what was happening on
the other side of the mountain? The peril that other
people were in moved his neighbours. Joseph Stagg
was affected himself. And for another reason.
</p>
<p>
Down in the thick woods, ten miles away, were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
two women and a child in a cabin. Suppose the fire
<em>should</em> cross the range?
</p>
<p>
The hardware merchant was striding along at a
quick pace when he came to the Parlow place; but he
was not going so fast that he did not hear the carpenter
hailing him in his cracked voice.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you, Joe Stagg! Hey, you!”
</p>
<p>
Amazed, Mr. Stagg turned to look. Parlow was
hobbling from the rear premises, groaning at every
step, scarcely able to walk.
</p>
<p>
“That sciatica’s got me ag’in,” he snarled. “I’m
a’most doubled up. Couldn’t climb into a carriage
to save my soul.”
</p>
<p>
“What d’you want to climb into a carriage for?”
demanded Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause somebody’s got to go for that gal of
mine—and little Car’lyn May. Ain’t you heard—or
is your mind so sot on makin’ money down there to
your store that you don’t know nothin’ else?”
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t I heard what?” returned the other with
fine restraint, for he saw the old man was in pain.
</p>
<p>
“The fire’s come over to this side. I saw the
flames myself. And Aaron Crummit drove through
and says that you can’t git by on the main road. The
fire’s followed the West Brook right down and is
betwixt us and Adams’ old camp.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” gasped the hardware dealer, paling
under his tan.
</p>
<p>
“Wal?” snarled Parlow. “Goin’ to stand there
chatterin’ all day, or be you goin’ to do something?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—THE FOREST FIRE</h2>
<p>
“Somebody must get over to that cabin and
bring them out,” Joseph Stagg said, without
taking offence at the crabbed old carpenter.
</p>
<p>
“Wal!” exclaimed Parlow, “glad ter see you’re
awake.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m awake,” the other returned shortly.
“I was just figuring on who’s got the best horse.”
</p>
<p>
“I have,” snapped Parlow.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And I’d decided on taking Cherry, too,”
the hardware dealer added, and swung into the lane
towards the carpenter’s barn.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you! Needn’t be so brash about it,”
growled the carpenter. “He’s my hoss, I s’pose?”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg went straight ahead, and without
answering. Having once decided on his course, he
wasted no time.
</p>
<p>
He rolled back the big door and saw Cherry
already harnessed in his boxstall. Mr. Parlow had
got that far, but knew that he could not attempt
putting the spirited creature into the shafts of the
light buckboard that was drawn out on the barn floor.
</p>
<p>
“You be as easy as ye can be with him, Joe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
Stagg,” groaned the carpenter, hanging to the doorframe.
“He’s touchy-and I don’t want him
abused.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve never driven a better horse than I have,
Jedidiah Parlow,” snapped the hardware merchant
as he led Cherry out of the stall.
</p>
<p>
Together they backed the animal between the
shafts, fastened the traces, and Mr. Stagg leaped
quickly to the seat and gathered up the reins.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll hafter take the Fallow Road,” the carpenter
shouted after him. “And have a care drivin’
Cherry——”
</p>
<p>
Horse and buckboard whirled out of the yard and
his voice was lost to the hardware merchant. The
latter looked neither to the right nor the left as he
drove through The Corners. On the store porch a
dozen idle men were congregated, but he had no time
for them. He did not even stop to warn Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
Cherry stepped out splendidly, and they left a
cloud of dust behind them as they rolled up the pike,
not in the direction of the abandoned camp. Forewarned,
he did not seek to take the shortest way to
the cabin where Amanda Parlow and Carolyn May
were perhaps even now threatened by the forest fire.
The Fallow Road turned north from the pike three
miles from The Corners.
</p>
<p>
Flecks of foam began to appear on Cherry’s
glossy coat almost at once. The air was very oppressive,
and there was no breeze.
</p>
<p>
This last fact Mr. Stagg considered a blessing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
With no movement of the air, the fire could not
spread rapidly.
</p>
<p>
The streak of flame that had followed down
the banks of West Brook moved mysteriously.
He could see the smoke of it now, hanging in a thick
cloud above the ravine through which the watercourse
flowed. He was tempted to believe that this
was a fire set on this side of the mountain ridge.
Yet Parlow had said he had seen the flames when
the fire crossed the summit.
</p>
<p>
The sweating horse kept up his unbroken stride,
and the buckboard—a frail-looking, but strongly
built, vehicle—bounded over the rough road at a
pace to distract one unused to such riding. But
Joseph Stagg cared nothing for the jolting. His
thought was wholly fixed on the fire and on those
who might be imperiled by it.
</p>
<p>
Amanda Parlow and his niece might even now be
threatened by the flames! The thought shook the
hardware dealer to his depths.
</p>
<p>
He was not a demonstrative man, that was true.
His strongest feelings he hid away in his heart; and
the world at large—even those nearest to him—suspected
little of the emotions that seethed in Joseph
Stagg’s heart and brain.
</p>
<p>
Towards Carolyn May he had finally shown something
of this deeper feeling. She had fairly forced
him to do this.
</p>
<p>
And his very soul hungered for Amanda Parlow.
But she was denied to him, and he shrank, as a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
with a raw wound shrinks from unskilful touch, from
letting anybody suspect his feeling for the carpenter’s
daughter.
</p>
<p>
Of late, since Amanda had spoken to him, since
the day when Caroline May and Chet Gormley had
been lost out on the ice and the nurse had so courageously
rung the chapel bell, Joseph Stagg’s mind
had been less on business than at any time in twenty
years.
</p>
<p>
He thought of Amanda Parlow. He saw her
while bending over the big ledger in the back office.
In his memory rang the low, mellow tones of her
voice. He even heard her laugh, although it had
been a score of years since he had actually been
within sound of her laughter.
</p>
<p>
Now that danger threatened the woman he had
loved all these years, it seemed as though his mind
and heart were numbed. He was terrified beyond
expression—terrified for her safety, and terrified for
fear that somebody, even Jedidiah Parlow, should
suspect just how he felt about it.
</p>
<p>
From the very first instant he had known the danger
of the women and the child, Joseph Stagg had
determined to get to them and save them. The
barrier of the fire itself should not keep him back.
</p>
<p>
The stillness and oppressiveness of the atmosphere
finally made an impression on his mind. He
noted that already the animal life of the forest
seemed to have taken fright and to have escaped.
Not a rabbit, not a squirrel, was in evidence. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
single jay winged his way through the wood, shrieking
discordantly. Although it was the height of the
mating season, the song birds were dumb.
</p>
<p>
The smoke grew heavier as he pushed on. It was
sharp in his nostrils, and his breathing became
laboured.
</p>
<p>
Cherry showed that he felt the stifling atmosphere,
too. He tossed his proud head and snorted.
Long strings of froth dripped from his bit, and his
whole body had turned dark with sweat. Mr. Parlow
might have felt doubtful of the horse’s well-being
had he seen Cherry now.
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer drove straight on. He
looked out for the horse’s pace, for he was a careful
driver, but he was out for no pleasure jaunt. There
was work for the horse to do.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg knew the country hereabout perfectly.
From boyhood he had hunted, fished, and
tramped all over the township. He was still five
miles from the camp, approaching it by a roundabout
way.
</p>
<p>
The horse’s hoofs rang sharply over the stony
path. Presently they capped a little ridge and started
down into a hollow. Not until they were over the
ridge was Mr. Stagg aware that the hollow was
filled, chokingly filled, with billowy white smoke.
</p>
<p>
There was, too, a crackling sound in the air.
V-points of red and yellow flame suddenly flecked
the bole of a tall, dead pine beside the path, and
right ahead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
Another man—one as cautious as the hardware
merchant notoriously was—would have pulled the
horse down to a walk. But Joseph Stagg’s cautiousness
had been flung to the winds. Instead, he
shouted to Cherry, and the beast increased his stride.
</p>
<p>
The man knew that hollow well. At the bottom
flowed Codler’s Creek, a larger stream than West
Brook. Indeed, West Brook joined its waters with
Codler’s Creek. The fire must have come into this
cut, too. Then, in all probability, a couple of thousand
acres of standing timber were afire on this side
of the mountain!
</p>
<p>
Ten rods further on the horse snorted, stumbled,
and tried to stop. A writhing, flaming snake—a
burning branch—plunged down through the smoke
directly ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Go on!” shouted Joseph Stagg, with a sharpness
that would ordinarily have set Cherry off at
a gallop.
</p>
<p>
But, as the snorting creature still shied, the man
seized the whip and lashed poor Cherry cruelly along
his flank.
</p>
<p>
At that the horse went mad. He plunged forward,
leaped the blazing brand, and galloped down
the road at a perilous gait. The man tried neither
to soothe him nor to retard the pace.
</p>
<p>
The smoke swirled around them. The driver
could not see ten feet beyond the horse’s nose. If a
tree should fall across the track, disaster was certain.
</p>
<p>
But this catastrophe did not occur. Within a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
furlongs, however, flames danced ahead on either
side of the road.
</p>
<p>
“The bridge!” gasped Joseph Stagg.
</p>
<p>
The bridge over the creek was a wooden structure
with a rustic railing on either hand. Flames had
seized upon this and were streaming up from the
rails.
</p>
<p>
It was fortunate that there was so little wind.
The flames were perpendicular and rose, as Joseph
Stagg sat in the buckboard, higher than his head.
</p>
<p>
The man leaned forward and once more laid the
whip along Cherry’s flank. Later, Mr. Parlow was
destined to mark both those welts and to vow that
“Joseph Stagg did not know how to treat a horse!”
</p>
<p>
Now, however, there was no thought in Joseph
Stagg’s mind regarding what Mr. Parlow might say
or think. He had to get over that blazing bridge!
</p>
<p>
Cherry took the platform in great leaps. The
bridge swung, sank, fire spurted through the planks
almost under the horse’s heels, and then, just as the
wheels left the shaking structure, the rear end of
the bridge slipped off the abutments. The fire must
have been eating out the heart of the timbers for two
hours.
</p>
<p>
Cherry ran madly. The smoke, the smarting of
several small burns, the loud crash of the falling
bridge maddened the horse to such a degree that
Joseph Stagg could scarcely hold him. Ten minutes
later they rattled down into the straight road, and
then, very soon, indeed, were at the abandoned camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
</p>
<p>
The fire was near, but it had not reached this
place. There was no sign of life about.
</p>
<p>
The man knew which was Judy’s cabin. He
leaped from the vehicle, leaving the panting Cherry
unhitched, and ran to the hut.
</p>
<p>
The door swung open. The poor furniture was
in place. Even the bedclothing was rumpled in the
old woman’s bunk. But neither she nor Amanda
Parlow nor little Carolyn May was there.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span><a name='chXXVI' id='chXXVI'></a>CHAPTER XXVI—THE LAUREL TO THE BRAVE</h2>
<p>
The heart of the man was like a weight in his
bosom. With so many hundred acres of
forest on fire, and that, too, between the
abandoned camp and The Corners and Sunrise Cove,
how would Amanda Parlow and Carolyn May know
where to go?
</p>
<p>
In what direction would they run? There was no
stream of any size near this camp. Water had been
obtained from easily driven wells. Mr. Stagg could
not imagine in that first few minutes of alarm how
the fugitives could have got away from the camp.
</p>
<p>
Smoke hung in a heavy cloud over the clearing.
The smell of burning wood was very strong.
</p>
<p>
To go was, perhaps, the wisest thing Amanda and
her charges could have done, for once the fire got
into this opening the place would soon become a raging
furnace.
</p>
<p>
The great heaps of sawdust and rubbish, as dry
as tinder, offered fuel for the flames unsurpassed
elsewhere in the forest. This clearing, three or four
acres in extent, would be the hottest part of the fire,
if once the wind rose and blew the conflagration in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
its direction. Mr. Stagg climbed to the roof of the
cabin to look over the open space. He shouted at
the top of his voice. But he neither saw nor heard
anything. His voice came back in a flat echo from
the forest wall across the clearing—that was all.
</p>
<p>
There was no way of trailing the fugitives—he
knew that well enough. Of course, there were plenty
of cartwheel tracks; but they told nothing of interest
to the troubled hardware dealer.
</p>
<p>
He slid down from the roof and went again into
the cabin. Certainly the place must have been deserted
in haste. There was Carolyn May’s coat.
The man caught it up and stared around, as though
expecting the child to be within sight.
</p>
<p>
The old woman’s clothing was scattered about,
too. It did not look as though anything had been
removed from the hut. Coming out, he found another
article on the threshold—one of Amanda’s
gloves.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg picked it up eagerly and stood for a
moment or two holding it in his hand as he gazed
from the doorway upon the empty prospect. Then
he lifted the crumpled glove to his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, God, spare her!” he burst forth. “Spare
them both!”
</p>
<p>
Then he kissed the glove again and hid it away in
the inner pocket of his vest.
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer tried to think of just what
the fugitives might have done when they escaped
from the cabin. Surely, they would not start for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
The Corners by the main road—that would take
them directly towards the fire. Joseph Stagg had
too good an opinion of Amanda Parlow’s common
sense to believe that.
</p>
<p>
And what would they do with the sick woman—how
take her with them? She was crippled and
could travel neither far nor fast.
</p>
<p>
This disappearance suggested to the man’s mind
one certain fact: Something had already happened
to the fugitives; some accident had befallen them.
</p>
<p>
The thought almost overpowered him. He was
chilled to the heart. Despair made him helpless for
the moment. He could think of nothing further to
do. He seemed to have come to an impassable
barrier.
</p>
<p>
The sight of poor Cherry, standing with heaving
sides and hanging head, awoke him. He started
into action once more and hurried to the horse. Taking
him out of the harness, he rubbed him down with
a coarse sack. Then he found a pail at the cabin
and brought the animal a drink. Once more he put
him back into the shafts and prepared to move on.
</p>
<p>
If it were true that Amanda would not run towards
the fire, then she more than likely had taken
the opposite direction on leaving the cabin. Therefore,
Joseph Stagg went that way—setting off down
the tote road, leading Cherry by his bridle.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he remembered calling Prince the day
Carolyn May had been lost on the ice. He raised
his voice in a mighty shout for the dog now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
</p>
<p>
“Prince! Princey, old boy! where are you?”
</p>
<p>
Again and again he called, but there was no reply.
The smoke was more stifling and the heat more intense
every minute. As he reached the far edge of
the clearing he looked back to see a huge tree break
into flame on the opposite side of the open space.
</p>
<p>
The camp would soon be a furnace of flame!
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg was not fearful for himself. He
knew a dozen paths out of this part of the forest.
But he could not leave without finding the fugitives
or learning the way of their departure.
</p>
<p>
The forest here was like a jungle on both sides of
the tote road. Once let the fire get into it, it would
burn with the intense heat of a blast furnace. Mr.
Stagg realised that he must get out quickly if he
would save himself and the horse.
</p>
<p>
He had just stepped into the buckboard again,
when there was an excited scrambling in the underbrush,
and a welcoming bark was given.
</p>
<p>
“Prince! Good boy!” the man shouted. “Where
are they?”
</p>
<p>
The excited dog flew at him, leaping on the buckboard
so as to reach him. The mongrel was delighted,
and showed it as plainly as a dumb brute
could.
</p>
<p>
But he was anxious, too. He leaped back to the
ground, ran a little ahead, and then looked back to
see if the man was following. The hardware dealer
shouted to him again:
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead, Princey! We’re coming!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p>
He picked up the reins and Cherry started. The
dog, barking his satisfaction, ran on ahead and
struck into a side path which led down a glade.
Joseph Stagg knew immediately where this path led
to. There was a spring and a small morass in the
bottom of the hollow.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” he thought, “once this fire gets to
going, the heat will lick up that spring in a
mouthful.”
</p>
<p>
He forced Cherry into the path. It was somewhat
difficult to push through with the buckboard.
Prince still barked, running ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Go on! Good dog!” cried Mr. Stagg. “Lead
the way to Hannah’s Car’lyn!”
</p>
<p>
He heard the little girl screaming: “Oh, Uncle
Joe! Oh, Uncle Joe! Here we are!”
</p>
<p>
Cherry rattled the buckboard down to the bottom
of the hollow and stopped. There was some smoke
here, but not much. The man leaped to the ground
when he saw a figure rise up from the foot of a tree
by the spring—a figure in brown.
</p>
<p>
“Joseph! Thank God!” murmured Amanda.
</p>
<p>
The hardware dealer strode to her. She had put
out both her hands to him, and he saw that they were
trembling, and that tears filled her great brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe!” she said, “I feared you would come
too late!”
</p>
<p>
“But I’m here, Mandy, and I’m not too late!”
he cried; and, somehow—neither of them could,
perhaps, have explained just how—his arms went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
around her and her hands rested on his shoulders,
while she looked earnestly into his face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe! Joe!” It was like a surrendering
sob.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not too late, is it, Mandy? Say it isn’t too
late!” he pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“No, it’s not too late,” she whispered. “If—if
we’re not too old.”
</p>
<p>
“Old!” almost shouted Joseph Stagg. “I don’t
remember of ever feeling so young as I do right
now!” and suddenly he stooped and kissed her.
“Bless me! what fools we’ve been all this time!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe! Oh, Miss Amanda!” cried
Carolyn May, standing before them, and pointing
with a rather grimy index finger. “You aren’t mad
at each other any more, are you? Oh, I am so
glad! so glad!” and her face showed her pleasure.
</p>
<p>
But the situation was too difficult to allow of
much but practical thoughts.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s the old woman?” asked Joseph Stagg
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Her husband came with a horse and buggy late
last night and took her over to the new camp,” was
the reply. “Of course, there was not room for Carolyn
May and me—and we did not wish to go, anyway.
</p>
<p>
“Judy is much better, poor soul, and I was glad
to be relieved of her care. Mr. Mason warned me
there was a big fire over the mountain, but I had no
idea it would come this way.”

<p>
“No. And nobody else,” grumbled Mr. Stagg.
“But it has come—and it’s moving mighty quick
now. How came you down here, Mandy—you and
Hannah’s Car’lyn?”
</p>
<p>
“We were really badly frightened, Joe,” she
replied, smiling up at him. “I’m afraid I became
panic-stricken when I saw a tall tree on fire not far
from the camp, and we ran down here where there
was water, leaving everything at the cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“But there isn’t water enough,” declared the
man fretfully. “That’s the trouble with this place.
We can’t stay here.”
</p>
<p>
“You know best, Joe,” said Amanda Parlow,
with a loving woman’s logic.
</p>
<p>
“What you’ve left at the cabin will have to stay
there,” he said. “We can’t go back. I tell you, the
fire was coming into the camp when I left.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe, we must hurry, then!” she murmured
simply.
</p>
<p>
“We aren’t going to be burned up now, when
Uncle Joe is here, Miss Mandy,” Carolyn May declared
with confidence. “See how nice he and Prince
found us? Why, they are reg’lar heroes, aren’t
they?”
</p>
<p>
“They are, indeed, child,” agreed the woman.
She turned to Joseph Stagg, happiness shining in
her eyes, and looking prettier than ever before in
her life, he thought.
</p>
<p>
The hollow was rapidly becoming filled with
smoke. The man did not understand this, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
foreboded trouble. He turned Cherry and the buckboard
around, and then he helped Amanda into the
seat.
</p>
<p>
“Up you go, too, Car’lyn May,” he said, lifting
the little girl into the rear of the buckboard. “Hang
on, there! Don’t dare fall off!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll be all right, Uncle Joe,” she declared,
laughing gaily. Then she said to Prince. “Don’t
run off, Princey. You mustn’t get lost from us now,
for the fire is coming.”
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg felt very serious as he seated himself
by Amanda’s side and picked up the reins. The
horse quickly retraced his steps up the hill to the tote
road. As they came out into this broader path they
saw the smoke pouring through it in a choking cloud.
The road was like a tunnel through the thick forest,
and the breeze, which was rising, drove the smoke
on. Behind, there was a subdued murmur and
crackling.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe,” gasped Amanda, “it’s coming!”
</p>
<p>
“It surely is,” agreed the hardware merchant.
“We’re in a hot corner, my girl. But trust to
me——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do, Joe!” she exclaimed, squeezing his
arm. “I am sure you know what is best to do.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try to prove that so,” he said with a subdued
chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe!” cried Carolyn May suddenly,
“can’t we get out of this awful smoke? It—it
chokes me!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait,” whispered Amanda to the man. “I’ll
lift her over the back of the seat. I think she had
better be in my lap.”
</p>
<p>
“P’r’aps that’s so,” he agreed, and he held in the
nervous Cherry for a moment till the change was
accomplished.
</p>
<p>
Poor little Carolyn May’s eyes had begun to
water, and she complained of a pain in her chest
from swallowing the smoke.
</p>
<p>
“I—I thought this was going to be an—an
<em>awfully</em> exciting adventure; but I don’t like it a bit
now!” the little girl sobbed.
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda held her close, and Uncle Joe
drove on as rapidly as possible. The way was rough
and they were jolted a good deal. Prince trotted
on behind them, his tongue out, and occasionally
coughing; but he was better off than his human
friends, for he was nearer the ground, where the
smoke was not so heavy.
</p>
<p>
There was just wind enough, and coming from
the right direction, to drive the smoke through the
tunnel of the wagon road. The fire itself was not
yet near. Joseph Stagg, nevertheless, was seriously
troubled by the situation.
</p>
<p>
Following the direction this road led, they would
be going farther and farther from home. And, if
the wind increased, it was very doubtful if they could
keep ahead of the fire for long.
</p>
<p>
However, he did not display his knowledge of
these troublesome facts to his companions. As for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
Amanda Parlow, she hugged the little girl tightly
and kept up a show of cheerful spirits.
</p>
<p>
Prince whined and yapped pleadingly, and the
man stopped for a moment to let the dog leap to
the rear of the buckboard, where he crouched,
panting.
</p>
<p>
It would not be wise for them to halt often, nor
for long. The wind, although steady, was rising.
The roaring of the fire grew louder and louder in
their ears.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Joseph Stagg dragged Cherry’s head
around. The horse snorted and hesitated, for the
smoke was blinding him.
</p>
<p>
“I pretty near missed these forks!” exclaimed
the hardware merchant. “This left road takes us
towards the lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe, can we reach it?” whispered Amanda.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve <em>got</em> to!” he returned grimly. “It’s
three miles, if it’s an inch, but Cherry has got to
make it.”
</p>
<p>
They were relieved after a minute or two in this
new road. The smoke had not so completely filled
it. But it was a rougher way, and the buckboard
bounced until Carolyn May cried out in fear and
the mongrel whined and sprawled all over the rear
platform.
</p>
<p>
“You want to hang on, dog, with teeth and toenails,”
said Joseph Stagg grimly. “We can’t stop
for you if you fall off.”
</p>
<p>
Prince seemed to know that, for never did animal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
cling more faithfully to an uneasy situation. Once
or twice he came near to being pitched clear of the
wagon body.
</p>
<p>
They drove over a little hillock that raised them
higher than the tote road had done. Amanda
clutched Mr. Stagg’s arm again and uttered a half-stifled
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
He shot a glance to the left. A mass of flame
broke out in the wood not far off this trail—the top
of a great tree was on fire.
</p>
<p>
“The wind is carrying brands this way,” muttered
the man. “A dozen new fires will be started. Well,
gid-ap, Cherry!” and he seized the whip again.
</p>
<p>
The horse was well spent now, but he was plucky.
He tried to increase his stride. A hot breath of
wind came rushing through the forest, bending the
branches and shaking the leafy foliage. The wind
seemed fairly to scorch the fugitives.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May had hidden her face on Miss
Amanda’s shoulder and was sobbing quietly. Both
of her human companions were painfully aware that
breathing the smoke-filled air was hurting them.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Stagg hurried the labouring horse on as
rapidly as he dared. Cherry coughed every few
steps; the man did not want to bring the horse to his
knees. Their very lives depended on the animal.
</p>
<p>
The roaring of the fire increased. Through the
more open woods which bordered this path they saw
the smoke advancing in a thicker wall—and one as
high as the tree tops. Through the curtain of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
smoke cloud red tongues of flame leaped forward to
lick up hungrily patches of underbrush or to fasten
on certain trees.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to make it, old boy,” muttered
Joseph Stagg, and he lashed the horse again.
</p>
<p>
The spirited Cherry leaped forward, both the
woman and the child screaming.
</p>
<p>
“Hang on,” advised Mr. Stagg. “The road
makes a turn just ahead, and that’s mighty lucky
for us.”
</p>
<p>
For he knew that the fire was roaring down toward
them, the wind having risen to a gale. The
crash of falling trees and the snapping of the fire
was like the sound from a battlefront. The noise
was almost deafening.
</p>
<p>
“Is it far? Is it far?” gasped Amanda in his
ear.
</p>
<p>
“Too far for comfort. But keep your heart up.”
</p>
<p>
As the man spoke, a blazing brand swung through
the air and came down, right on Amanda’s shoulders.
Carolyn May shrieked. Joseph Stagg brushed off
the burning stick.
</p>
<p>
Cherry mounted another small ridge and then
they clattered down into a little hollow where there
was a slough beside the road. The water was green
and stagnant, but it was water.
</p>
<p>
The man pulled in the hard-pressed horse and
leaped down, passing the reins to Amanda. He
whipped off his coat and dipped it in the mudhole.
He drew it out dripping with water and slime.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
</p>
<p>
“Look out, here! Have to shut your eyes!” he
warned his two companions on the seat of the buckboard,
and threw the saturated coat over Miss
Amanda’s head. The dripping garment sheltered
Carolyn May as well.
</p>
<p>
“Now, good horse!” he yelled to Cherry, leaping
back to the seat. “<em>Gid-ap!</em>”
</p>
<p>
The horse started up the slope. Another swirling
brand came down upon them. Joseph Stagg fought
it off with his bare hand. His shirt sleeve caught
fire and he was painfully burned on the forearm
before he could smother the blaze.
</p>
<p>
It was growing so hot now that the leaves on the
trees curled and were blasted before the flames actually
reached them. Behind the fleeing buckboard the
conflagration was on both sides of the narrow path.
They were barely keeping ahead of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
Another flaming brand fell, landing on Cherry’s
back. The horse squealed and leaped forward at
a pace which Mr. Stagg could not control. Maddened
by the burn, Cherry had taken the bit in his
teeth and was running away.
</p>
<p>
The man threw down the reins. He could do
nothing towards retarding the frightened horse’s
pace. Indeed, he did not want to stop him.
</p>
<p>
His left arm he flung around Miss Amanda and
the child, and with his right hand clung to the rocking
seat of the careening buckboard.
</p>
<p>
The wet steaming coat saved the woman and the
child from injury. More than one brand settled on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
it, and the garment only smoked. But Joseph Stagg
was painfully burned.
</p>
<p>
On and on dashed the maddened horse. It was a
mercy, indeed, that the buckboard was not overturned.
</p>
<p>
Sparks rose from burning brush clumps and flew
over them in a shower. Prince yelped and whined
pitifully, but, like Mr. Stagg, he hung on.
</p>
<p>
The burning and smouldering brands showered
upon them. Bushes broke out into flame in advance,
and on either side of the path. It was as though the
combustion was spontaneous.
</p>
<p>
With a roaring like the charge of a field of artillery,
a great mass of flame flew high over their
heads. The tall trees were on fire on all sides.
They were in the heart of the conflagration!
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg had lost all count of time. The forest
road might still extend ahead of them for a mile,
for all he knew.
</p>
<p>
But suddenly they broke cover, Cherry still galloping
wildly, and plunged down an open ravine to
the edge of a lake of sparkling water.
</p>
<p>
“Bless me! The lake! the lake!” hoarsely
shouted the man.
</p>
<p>
The walls of the ravine sheltered them from
smoke and fire for a moment, but the brands still
fell. Cherry had halted on the edge of the lake, but
Joseph Stagg urged him on into the water, flank
deep. The shore was narrow and afforded little
space for refuge. He lifted Amanda and the child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
bodily from the seat and dropped them into the
water.
</p>
<p>
“We’re safe now,” he said hoarsely, jumping in
himself, and holding Carolyn May and Amanda.
“We’ve got water enough here, thanks be! Hang
on to me, Mandy. I’m not going to let you get
away—no more, never!”
</p>
<p>
And by the way in which the woman clung to his
arm it was evident that she did not propose to lose
him.
</p>
<p>
They looked back at the roaring wall of flame.
The forest was a seething furnace. Smoke drifted
out over the lake in a heavy cloud. Dead embers
showered about them. Prince rolled and burrowed
in the damp sand at the edge of the water. Cherry
filled his throat with a long, cool, satisfying draught.
</p>
<p>
“My, Uncle Joe! you are just the bravest man!”
declared Carolyn May, finding her voice. “Isn’t
he, Miss Mandy? And, see, his arm is all burned.
Dear me, we must get home to Aunty Rose and let
her do it up for him.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII—“TWO’S COMPANY”</h2>
<p>
Towards the east the forest tract was completely
burned to the banks of Codler’s Creek.
As the wind which had sprung up had driven
the fire westward, there was little danger of the
flames pressing nearer than the creek to Sunrise Cove
and The Corners.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Stagg led the horse out of the water and
advised Miss Amanda and Carolyn May to get into
the seat of the buckboard again. Then he set
forth, leading the horse along the narrow beach,
while Prince followed wearily in the rear.
</p>
<p>
It was a rough route they followed, but the blackened
forest was still too hot for them to pass
through, had they been able to find a path. This
was a lonely strip of shore and they saw no living
soul but themselves.
</p>
<p>
Some trees were still smouldering along the creek
banks. They could see these fires when they crossed
the mouth of the stream, for the dusk had fallen
and the flames sparkled like fireflies.
</p>
<p>
It was a long tramp, and the horse, the dog, and
the man were alike wearied. Carolyn May went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
fast asleep with her head pillowed in Miss Amanda’s
lap.
</p>
<p>
The latter and Joseph Stagg talked much. Indeed,
there was much for them to say after all these years
of silence.
</p>
<p>
The woman, worn and scorched of face, looked
down on the smutted and sweating man with an expression
in her eyes that warmed him to the marrow.
She was proud of him. And the gaze of love
and longing that the hardware merchant turned upon
Amanda Parlow would have amazed those people
that believed he had consideration and thought only
for business.
</p>
<p>
In these few hours of alarm and close intimacy
the man and the woman had leaped all the barriers
time and pride had set up. Nothing further could
keep Joseph Stagg and Amanda Parlow apart. And
yet they never for one instant discussed the original
cause of their estrangement. That was a dead
issue.
</p>
<p>
The refugees reached The Corners about nine
o’clock. Jedidiah Parlow had hobbled up to the
store and was just then organising a party of searchers
to go to the rescue of the hardware dealer and
those of whom he had set out in search.
</p>
<p>
The village turned out <em>en masse</em> to welcome the
trio who had so miraculously escaped the fire.
Aunty Rose’s relief knew no bounds. Mr. Parlow
was undeniably glad to see his daughter safe; otherwise,
he would never have overlooked the pitiable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
state his horse was in. Poor Cherry would never
be the same unblemished animal again.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I vum” he said to Joseph Stagg, “you
done it! Better’n I could, too, I reckon. I’ll take
the hoss home. You comin’ with me, Mandy?”
Then he saw the burns on the younger man’s shoulders
and arms. “The good land of Jehoshaphat!
here’s work for you to do, Mandy. If you air any
sort of a nurse, I reckon you got your hands full right
here with Joe Stagg,” he added, with some pride in
his daughter’s ability. “Phew! them’s bad-lookin’
burns!”
</p>
<p>
“They are indeed,” agreed Aunty Rose.
</p>
<p>
It was a fact that Mr. Stagg was in a bad state.
Carolyn May had suggested that Aunty Rose would
dress his burns, but Miss Amanda would allow nobody
to do that but herself.
</p>
<p>
When the curious and sympathetic neighbours had
gone and Miss Amanda was still busy making Joseph
Stagg comfortable in the sitting-room, Aunty Rose
came out into the kitchen, where she had already
bathed and helped Carolyn May to undress, and
where the little girl was now sleepily eating her supper
of bread and milk.
</p>
<p>
“Well, wonders don’t ever cease, I guess,” she
said, more to herself than to her little confidant.
“Who’d have thought it!”
</p>
<p>
“Who’d have thought what, Aunty Rose?” inquired
Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“Your uncle and Mandy Parlow have made it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
up,” breathed the woman, evidently much impressed
by the wonder of it.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed!” cried the child. “Isn’t it nice?
They aren’t mad at each other any more.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I should say they’re not,” Aunty Rose observed
with grimness. “Far from it. It’s a fact! I
wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it with
my own eyes. They haven’t got eyes for anybody
but each other.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Haven’t they, Aunty Rose?” queried
Carolyn May with sudden earnestness.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not, child! Holding hands in there
like a pair of—Well, do you know what it means,
Carolyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“That they love each other,” the child said
boldly. “And I’m <em>so</em> glad for them!”
</p>
<p>
“So am I,” declared the woman, still in a whisper.
“But it means changes here. Things won’t
be the same for long. I know Joseph Stagg for
what he is.”
</p>
<p>
“What is he, Aunty Rose?” asked Carolyn May
in some trepidation, for the housekeeper seemed to
be much moved.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a very determined man. Once he gets set
in a way, he carries everything before him. Mandy
Parlow is going to be made Mrs. Joseph Stagg so
quick that it’ll astonish her. Now, you believe me,
Carolyn May.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” was the little girl’s comment.
</p>
<p>
“There’ll be changes here very sudden. ‘Two’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
company, three’s a crowd,’ Carolyn May. Never
was a truer saying. Those two will want just each
other—and nobody else.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aunty Rose!” murmured the little girl
faintly. She had stopped eating the bread and milk.
The housekeeper was too deeply interested in her
own cogitations to notice how the child was being
affected by her speech.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve told him a thousand times he should be
married,” concluded Aunty Rose. “And if Mandy
Parlow’s the woman for him, then it’s all right.
Whether she is or not, he’ll marry her. Jedidiah
or a thousand others couldn’t stop Joseph Stagg now.
I know what it means with him when he once makes
up his mind.
</p>
<p>
“But there’ll be no room here for anybody but
those two, with their billing and cooing. ‘Two’s
company, three’s a crowd.’
</p>
<p>
“Well, Carolyn May, if you’ve finished your supper,
we’d better go up to bed. It’s long past your
bedtime.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Aunty Rose,” said the little girl in a muffled
voice.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose did not notice that Carolyn May did
not venture to the door of the sitting-room to bid
either Uncle Joe or Miss Amanda good-night. The
child followed the woman upstairs with faltering
steps, and in the unlighted bedroom that had been
Hannah Stagg’s she knelt at Aunty Rose’s knee and
murmured her usual petitions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do bless Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda, now
they’re so happy,” was a phrase that might have
thrilled Aunty Rose at another time. But she was
so deep in her own thoughts that she heard what
Carolyn May said perfunctorily.
</p>
<p>
With her customary kiss, she left the little girl
and went downstairs. Carolyn May had seen so
much excitement during the day that she might have
been expected to sleep at once, and that soundly.
But it was not so.
</p>
<p>
The little girl lay with wide-open eyes, her imagination
at work.
</p>
<p>
“Two’s company, three’s a crowd.” She took
that trite saying, in which Aunty Rose had expressed
her own feelings, to herself. If Uncle Joe and Miss
Amanda were going to be married, <em>they would not
want anybody else around</em>! Of course not!
</p>
<p>
Somewhere, somehow, in listening to older people
talk, Carolyn May had obtained the impression that
all couples desired to be by themselves just as soon
as they were married. They had no need nor desire
for other people. Her idea was that the so-called
“honeymoon” extended over long, long months.
</p>
<p>
“And what will become of me?” thought Carolyn
May chokingly.
</p>
<p>
All the “emptiness” of the last few months swept
over the soul of the little child in a wave that her
natural cheerfulness could not withstand. Her anchorage
in the love of Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda
was swept away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
She was going to be alone again. There would be
nobody whose right it was to care for her. With
her mother and father drowned in a foreign sea and
Uncle Joe utterly taken up with the “lovely lady”
he loved, who was there to care for Carolyn May?
</p>
<p>
The heart of the little child swelled. Her eyes
overflowed. She sobbed herself to sleep, the pillow
muffling the sounds, more forlorn than ever before
since she had come to The Corners.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII—THE JOURNEY</h2>
<p>
It was certainly a fact that Amanda Parlow immediately
usurped some power in the household
of the Stagg homestead. She ordered Joseph
Stagg not to go down to his store that next day.
And he did not!
</p>
<p>
Nor could he attend to business for several days
thereafter. He was too stiff and lame and his burns
were too painful.
</p>
<p>
Chet Gormley came up each day for instructions
and was exceedingly full of business. A man would
have to be very exacting indeed to find fault with
the interest the boy displayed in running the store
just as his employer desired it to be run.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you what it is, Car’lyn,” Chet drawled, in
confidence. “I’m mighty sorry Mr. Stagg got hurt
like he did. But lemme tell you, it’s jest givin’ me
the chance of my life!
</p>
<p>
“Why, maw says that Mr. Stagg and Miss
Mandy Parlow’ll git married for sure now!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” sighed the little girl. “They’ll be
married.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, when folks git married they allus go off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
on a trip. Course, <em>they</em> will. And me—I’ll be runnin’
the business all by myself. It’ll be great! Mr.
Stagg will see jest how much value I be to him.
Why, it’ll be the makin’ of me!” cried the optimistic
youth.
</p>
<p>
Yes, Carolyn May heard it on all sides. Everybody
was talking about the affair of Uncle Joe and
Miss Amanda.
</p>
<p>
Every time she saw her uncle and her “pretty
lady” together the observant child could not but
notice that they were utterly wrapped up in each
other. It is only between lovers who have been
heart-hungry for long years, as these two had,
that a perfectly open expression of affection is maintained.
</p>
<p>
The modest spinster and the bashful bachelor
seemed to have sloughed off their former natures.
They had developed a new and exceedingly strange
life, as different from their former existence as the
butterfly’s is from the caterpillar’s.
</p>
<p>
Miss Amanda could not go past the easy chair
in which the hardware dealer was enthroned without
touching him. He, as bold as a boy, would seize
her hand and kiss it. Her soft, capable hand would
linger on his head in so tender a gesture that it
might have brought tears to the eyes of a sympathetic
observer.
</p>
<p>
Love, a mighty, warm, throbbing spirit, had
caught them up and swept them away out of themselves—out
of their old selves, at least. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
eyes only for each other—thoughts only for each
other.
</p>
<p>
Even a child could see something of this. The
absorption of the two made Aunty Rose’s remarks
very impressive to Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
A week of this followed—a week in which the
trouble in Carolyn May’s heart and brain seethed
until it became unbearable. She was convinced that
there would soon be no room for her in the big house.
She watched Aunty Rose pack her own trunk, and the
old lady looked very glum, indeed. She heard whispers
of an immediate marriage, here in the house,
with Mr. Driggs as the officiating clergyman.
</p>
<p>
Everybody in the neighbourhood was interested
in the affair and eagerly curious; but Carolyn May
could not talk about it. They thought she had been
instructed not to speak of the matter, but the little
girl only felt that she would cry if she talked of this
event that was to make her uncle and Miss Amanda
so happy and herself so miserable.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Prince!” she sobbed, clinging around the
dog’s neck out under their favourite tree in the back
yard of the Stagg place, “nobody wants us. We
never ought to have come here. Maybe it would
have been better if we <em>had</em> gone to the poorhouse.
</p>
<p>
“Only, I s’pose, they wouldn’t have wanted you,
my dear. And you are the very best friend I’ve got,
Prince. You are! you are! <em>You</em> wouldn’t go off
and get married, would you?
</p>
<p>
“And I want ’em to be happy, too. Of course I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
do! But—but I didn’t know it was goin’ to be like
this. I—I wish I was back in our old home in New
York. Don’t you wish so, Princey?
</p>
<p>
“There we had things that were our very own.
Even if my mamma and papa aren’t there, it would
be nice, I think. And Mr. and Mrs. Price would
be kind to us—and Edna. And there’s the janitor’s
boy—he was a real nice boy. And all the little girls
we knew at school there.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Carolyn May, suddenly jumping up
and dashing away her tears, “I would just <em>love</em> to
go back there. And we <em>could</em>, Princey! I’ve got
more’n ten dollars in my bank, for Uncle Joe gave
me a ten-dollar gold piece at Christmas. That’s
more’n enough to take us back home. Oh, it is!
it is!”
</p>
<p>
The child’s excitement thrilled her through and
through. Her eyes brightened and the flush came
into her cheeks. She knew, through Chet Gormley,
that Mr. Stagg had never done anything with the
furniture in the flat. Her home—just as it had been
when her mother and father were alive—was back
there in New York City. She had been happy at
The Corners in a way. But it was not the happiness
she had known in her old home.
</p>
<p>
And now she believed that she saw great changes
coming. Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda would be
just as Aunty Rose had hinted—so deeply engaged
with each other that they would have no time or
thought for a sunny-haired and blue-eyed little girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
who had brought, all unknown to herself, a new
creed into the lives of many of the adults of The
Corners.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was not a sly child, but she was a
secretive one. There is a difference. She had many
thoughts in her little head that her adult friends did
not suspect. She studied things out for herself. Being
a child, her conclusions were not always wise
ones.
</p>
<p>
She felt that she might be a stumbling-block to the
complete happiness of Uncle Joe and Amanda Parlow.
They might have to set aside their own desires
because of her. She felt vaguely that this must
not be.
</p>
<p>
“I can go home,” she repeated over and over to
herself.
</p>
<p>
“Home” was still in the New York City apartment
house where she had lived so happily before
that day when her father and mother had gone
aboard the ill-fated <em>Dunraven</em>.
</p>
<p>
Their complete loss out of the little girl’s life had
never become fixed in her mind. It had never
seemed a surety—not even after her talks with the
sailor, Benjamin Hardy.
</p>
<p>
Hardy had long since left the locality, having
taken a berth again on one of the lake schooners.
Nobody seemed to have much time to give to Carolyn
May just at this time. Wherever she wandered
about the neighbourhood people were talking about
the coming wedding of Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
Even Miss Minnie, at school, was quite in a flutter
over it.
</p>
<p>
Friday afternoon the little girl went to the churchyard
and made neat the three little graves and the
one long one on the plot which belonged to Aunty
Rose Kennedy. She almost burst into tears that
evening, too, when she kissed Aunty Rose good-night
at bedtime. Uncle Joe was down at the Parlows.
He and Mr. Parlow actually smoked their pipes together
in harmony on the cottage porch.
</p>
<p>
Aunty Rose was usually an early riser; but the
first person up at The Corners on that Saturday
morning was Carolyn May. She was dressed a full
hour before the household was usually astir.
</p>
<p>
She came downstairs very softly, carrying the
heavy bag she had brought with her the day she had
first come to The Corners. She had her purse in her
pocket, with all her money in it, and she had in the
bag most of her necessary possessions. She wore a
black dress, but not the one she had worn when she
came from New York. That had been outgrown
long since.
</p>
<p>
She washed her face and hands. Her hair was
already combed and neatly braided. From the
pantry she secured some bread and butter, and, with
this in her hand, unlocked the porch door and went
out. Prince got up, yawning, and shook himself.
She sat on the steps to eat the bread and butter,
dividing it with Prince.
</p>
<p>
“This is such a beautiful place, Princey,” she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
whispered to the mongrel. “We are going to miss
it dreadfully, I s’pose. But, then— Well, we’ll
have the park. Only, you can’t run so free there.”
</p>
<p>
Prince whined. Carolyn May got up and shook
the crumbs from her lap. Then she unchained the
dog and picked up her bag. Prince pranced about
her, glad to get his morning run.
</p>
<p>
The little girl and the dog went out of the gate
and started along the road towards Sunrise Cove.
Nobody seemed to be astir. She looked back and
waved her hand at the Stagg house. She looked at
the church, the blacksmith shop, and the store. She
bade them all good-bye.
</p>
<p>
Prince came to walk beside her and whined. He
evidently could not understand her going away from
the place so early.
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May knew what she was about. She
knew all about the train that went south. It left
Sunrise Cove station before most people were up,
even at this time of year.
</p>
<p>
The houses had all been asleep at The Corners.
So was the Parlow cottage when she trudged by.
She would have liked to see Miss Amanda, to kiss
her just once. But she must not think of that! It
brought such a “gulpy” feeling into her throat.
</p>
<p>
Nobody saw Carolyn May and Prince until she
reached Main Street. Then the sun had risen, and
a few early persons were astir; but nobody appeared
who knew the child or who cared anything about her.
</p>
<p>
At the railroad station nobody spoke to her, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
she bought no ticket. She was not exactly clear in
her mind about tickets, anyway. She had found the
conductor on the train coming up from New York a
kind and pleasant man, and she decided to do all her
business with him.
</p>
<p>
Had she attempted to buy a ticket of the station
agent, undoubtedly he would have made some inquiry.
As it was, when the train came along, Carolyn
May, after seeing Prince put into the baggage
car, climbed aboard with the help of a brakeman.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, if he howls <em>awfully</em>,” she told the
baggageman, who gave her a check without question,
“I shall have to go in that car and sit with him.”
</p>
<p>
There were not many people in the car. They
steamed away from Sunrise Cove, and Carolyn May
dabbled her eyes with her handkerchief and told herself
to be brave.
</p>
<p>
The stations were a long way apart and the conductor
did not come through for some time. When
he did open the door and come into the car Carolyn
May started up with a glad cry. It was the very
conductor who had been so kind to her on the trip
up from New York.
</p>
<p>
The railroad man knew her at once and shook
hands most heartily with her.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going, Carolyn May?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“All the way with you, sir,” she replied.
</p>
<p>
“To New York?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir. I’m going home again.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll see you later,” he said, without asking
for her ticket.
</p>
<p>
The conductor remembered the little girl very
well, although he did not remember all the details of
her story. Nine months before she had gone up to
Sunrise Cove with him to visit relatives. As she had
travelled alone then, he did not think it strange that
she was now travelling back again without any
guardian.
</p>
<p>
By-and-by he came back and sat down beside her.
Carolyn May took out her purse and offered him
money for her fare.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t they buy you a ticket?” he asked in
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” she told him honestly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll tend to it for you. You’ll want that
money for candy and moving-picture shows in the
city.”
</p>
<p>
He was very kind to her and brought her satisfying
news about Prince in the baggage car. The
brakeman was nice, too, and brought her water to
drink in a paper cup. And even the “candy butcher”
made the journey pleasanter by his attentions. He
once dropped a package of candy in Carolyn May’s
lap and then forgot to pick it up again!
</p>
<p>
So, altogether, she had a pleasant, if tiresome,
ride to New York City.
</p>
<p>
At one place the brakeman brought into the car
for her some sandwiches and a glass of milk. He
assured her, too, that the men in the baggage car
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
had divided their lunches with Prince and had given
him water.
</p>
<p>
She slept part of the time, and while she was
awake there was so much going on that she could
not feel very lonely. The excitement of travelling
had taken that empty feeling out of her heart.
</p>
<p>
At last, the long stretches of streets at right angles
with the tracks appeared—asphalt streets lined with
tall apartment houses. This could be nothing but
New York City. Her papa had told her long ago
that there was no other city like it in the world.
</p>
<p>
She knew One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street
and its elevated station. That was not where she
had boarded the train going north, when Mr. Price
had placed her in the conductor’s care, but it was
nearer her old home—that she knew. So she told
the brakeman she wanted to get out there, and he
arranged to have Prince released.
</p>
<p>
The little girl alighted and got her dog without
misadventure. She was down on the street level
before the train continued on its journey downtown.
</p>
<p>
At the Grand Central Terminal the conductor was
met with a telegram sent from Sunrise Cove by a
certain frantic hardware dealer, and that telegram
told him something about Carolyn May of which he
had not thought to ask.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX—THE HOMING OF CAROLYN MAY</h2>
<p>
It was some distance from the railroad station to
the block on which Carolyn May Cameron had
lived all her life until she had gone to stay with
Uncle Joe Stagg. The child knew she could not take
the car, for the conductor would not let Prince ride.
</p>
<p>
She started with the dog on his leash, for he was
not muzzled. The bag became heavy very soon, but
she staggered along with it uncomplainingly.
</p>
<p>
Her dishevelled appearance, with the bag and the
dog, gave people who noticed her the impression that
Carolyn May had been away, perhaps, for a “fresh-air”
vacation, and was now coming home, brown and
weary, to her expectant family.
</p>
<p>
But Carolyn May knew that she was coming home
to an empty apartment—to rooms that echoed with
her mother’s voice and in which lingered only memories
of her father’s cheery spirit.
</p>
<p>
Yet it was the only home, she felt, that was left
for her.
</p>
<p>
She could not blame Uncle Joe and Miss Amanda
for forgetting her. Aunty Rose had been quite disturbed,
too, since the forest fire. She had given the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
little girl no hint that provision would be made for
her future.
</p>
<p>
Wearily, Carolyn May travelled through the
Harlem streets, shifting the bag from hand to hand,
Prince pacing sedately by her side.
</p>
<p>
“We’re getting near home now, Princey,” she told
him again and again.
</p>
<p>
Thus she tried to keep her heart up. She came to
the corner near which she had lived so long, and
Prince suddenly sniffed at the screened door of a
shop.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, poor fellow! That’s the butcher’s,”
Carolyn May said.
</p>
<p>
She bought a penny afternoon paper on a newsstand
and then went into the shop and got a nickel’s
worth of bones and scraps for the dog. The clerk
did not know her, for he was a new man.
</p>
<p>
They ventured along their block. The children
all seemed strange to Carolyn May. But people
move so frequently in Harlem that this was not at all
queer. She hoped to see Edna or some other little
girl with whom she had gone to school. But not
until she reached the very house itself did anybody
hail her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Carolyn May! Is that you?”
</p>
<p>
A lame boy was looking through the iron fence
of the areaway. He was the janitor’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Johnny! I’m real glad to see you!” cried
the little girl. Then she added more slowly: “We—we’ve
come home again—me and Prince.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ve growed a lot, Carolyn May,” said the
boy. “My pop and mom’s away.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go up into Edna’s flat, then,” the weary little
girl sighed.
</p>
<p>
“The Prices have gone away, too. They won’t
be back till to-morrow some time.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” murmured Carolyn May.
</p>
<p>
“But, say, I can get the keys to your flat. The
water’s turned on, too. Everything’s all right up
there, for Mrs. Price she sweeps and dusts it all
every once in a while. Shall I get the keys?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you will, please!” returned the relieved
child.
</p>
<p>
The boy hobbled away, but soon returned with
the outer-door key and the key to the apartment
itself. Carolyn May took them and thanked him.
Then she gladly went in and climbed the two flights
to their floor.
</p>
<p>
She saw nobody, and easily let herself into the flat.
It had been recently aired and dusted. Every piece
of furniture stood just as she remembered it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Princey, it’s <em>home</em>!” she whispered. “This
is our real, real home! I—I loved ’em all at The
Corners; but it wasn’t like <em>this</em> there!”
</p>
<p>
Prince perhaps agreed, but he was too deeply interested
in snuffing at the package of meat scraps she
had purchased for his supper to reply.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, Prince,” she said, “you shall have
it at once.”
</p>
<p>
Dropping the bag in the private hall, she went into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
the kitchen and stood on tiptoe to open the door of
the closet above the dresser. Securing a plate, she
emptied the contents of the paper into it, and set the
plate down on the floor.
</p>
<p>
In spreading out the paper she saw some big-type
headlines on the front page:
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>ROMANCE OF THE GREAT WAR</p>
</div>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
<em>The Experiences of This Newspaper Man like
Those of a Character in a Novel—Lost for Eight
Months in the Desert—At the Mercy of Semi-savage
Tribes, Man and Wife Escape at Last to
Return in Safety and Health.</em>
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p><em>His Story Told to Beacon Reporter at Quarantine.</em></p>
</div>
<p>
Carolyn May read no further. It did not particularly
interest a little girl. Besides, she was very
tired—too tired to think of her own supper. Had
she read on, however, even her simple mind might
have been startled by the following paragraphs
printed below the heading of this startling story:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Their wonderful good fortune in escaping from
the disaster that overtook the steamer on which they
travelled and which was caught between the gunfire
of a French battleship and two of a Turkish squadron
can only be equalled by the chance which followed.
Naturally, as a journalist himself, Mr. Cameron
is prepared to tell the details of his remarkable
adventure in the columns of the <em>Beacon</em> at a later
date.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“The boat in which they left the sinking <em>Dunraven</em>
was separated in the night and fog from that
of the other refugees and was carried by the current
far to the south. In fact, they were enveloped by
fog until they landed upon a stretch of deserted
beach.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“There was no town near, nor even an encampment
of Arabs. But soon after their disembarkation
and before the officer in command could take means
to communicate with any civilised, or semi-civilised,
place a party of mounted and armed tribesmen
swooped down on the castaways.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“These people, being Mohammedans, and having
seen the battle the day before between the French
and the Turks, considered the castaways enemies
and swept them away with them into the desert to a
certain oasis, where for nearly eight months Mr.
John Lewis Cameron and his wife and the other
refugees from the <em>Dunraven</em> were kept without being
allowed to communicate with their friends.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mr. Cameron was on furlough from his paper
because of ill-health. At the beginning of his captivity
he was in a very bad way, indeed, it is said.
But the months in the hot, dry atmosphere of the
desert have made a new man of him, and he personally
cannot hold much rancour against the Mohammedan
tribe that held him a prisoner.”
</p>
<p>
There was more of the wonderful story, but the
sleepy little girl had given it no attention whatsoever.
Prince had eaten and lain down in his familiar corner.
The little girl had gone softly into her own
room and made up her bed as she had seen her
mother and Mrs. Price make it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>
</p>
<p>
Then she turned on the water in the bathtub and
took a bath. It was delightful to have a real tub
instead of the galvanised bucket they used at Uncle
Joe’s.
</p>
<p>
She put on her nightgown at last, knelt and said
her prayer, including that petition she had never left
out of it since that first night she had knelt at Aunty
Rose’s knee:
</p>
<p>
“God bless my papa and mamma and bring them
safe home.”
</p>
<p>
The faith that moves mountains was in that
prayer.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX—THE HOUSE OF BEWILDERMENT</h2>
<p>
Carolyn May slept the sleep of the
wearied, if not of the carefree. The noises
of the street did not disturb her, not even the
passing of the fire-department trucks some time after
midnight.
</p>
<p>
Nor did nearer sounds arouse her. She had no
knowledge of the fact that a procession of A.D.T.
boys and messengers from the railroad company
came to ring the bell of the Prices’ apartment. Later
the janitor’s family was aroused, but the little lame
boy thought it would be better for him to say nothing
about having seen Carolyn May and of having given
her the keys.
</p>
<p>
So when, in the early morning, a taxicab stopped
at the street door and a bushy-haired, troubled-looking
man got out and helped a woman clad in brown
to the sidewalk, the janitor had no knowledge of the
fact that Carolyn May and Prince were upstairs in
the apartment that had been so long empty.
</p>
<p>
“And the Prices are away,” said Uncle Joe in a
troubled voice. “What do you think of that,
Mandy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe! where could the dear child have
gone?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t seen her,” declared the janitor. “But
I can let you into the flat. There’s been lots of telegrams
to Mr. Price in the night—and they weren’t
all yours. You’re Carolyn May’s uncle, ain’t you?”
he asked Mr. Stagg.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Joe acknowledged the relationship. “Let’s
go upstairs,” he said to Amanda. “Now that I’m
here—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Joe!” almost wept Amanda, “could
anything have happened to her in this big city?”
</p>
<p>
“’Most anything, I s’pose,” growled Joseph
Stagg, following close on the janitor’s heels.
</p>
<p>
The janitor’s passkey grating in the lock of the
private hall door started something that none of
them expected. A startling bark echoed in the rooms
which were supposed to be empty.
</p>
<p>
“Whatever is that?” gasped the janitor.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Prince! It’s her dog!” shouted Uncle Joe.
</p>
<p>
“The child is here!” cried Amanda Parlow, and
she was the first to enter the apartment.
</p>
<p>
Prince bounded wildly to meet her. He leaped
and barked. A cry sounded from a room beyond.
Miss Amanda and Uncle Joe rushed in.
</p>
<p>
Sleepily, her face flushed, rubbing her blue eyes
wide open, Carolyn May sat up in bed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Uncle Joe! Oh, Miss Amanda!” she said.
“I—I was just dreaming my own papa and mamma
had come home and found me here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
</p>
<p>
“My dear! My <em>dear</em>!” sobbed Amanda Parlow,
dropping to her knees beside the bed.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a great young one!” growled Uncle Joe,
blowing his nose suspiciously. “You’ve nigh about
scared ev’rybody to death. Your Aunty Rose is
almost crazy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh—I’m—sorry,” stammered Carolyn May.
“But—you—see—Uncle Joe! you and Miss
Amanda are going to be happy now. Aunty Rose
says ‘two is comp’ny.’ So you wouldn’t have room
for me.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me!” gasped the hardware dealer.
“What do you know about this child’s feeling that
way, Mandy?”
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we have been selfish, Joe,” the
woman said, sighing. “And that is something that
Carolyn May has never been in her life!”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno—I dunno,” said Uncle Joe ruefully, and
looking at the little, flowerlike face of the child.
“How about Aunty Rose? How d’you s’pose she
feels about Hannah’s Car’lyn running away?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“It may be that ‘two’s company and three’s a
crowd,’ but you and Aunty Rose would be two likewise,
wouldn’t you, Car’lyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I never thought of that, Uncle Joe,” the child
whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Why, your running away from The Corners this
way is like to make both Mandy and me unhappy, as
well as Aunty Rose. I—I don’t b’lieve Mandy could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
get married at all if she didn’t have a little girl like
you to carry flowers and hold up her train. How
about it, Mandy?”
</p>
<p>
“That is quite true, Carolyn May,” declared Miss
Amanda, hugging the soft little body of the child
tightly again.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I—I——”
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May was, for once, beyond verbal expression.
Besides, there was a noise in the outer hall
and on the stairway. The door had been left open
by the surprised janitor.
</p>
<p>
A burst of voices came into the apartment. Uncle
Joe turned wonderingly. Miss Amanda stood up.
Carolyn May flew out of bed with a shriek that
startled them both.
</p>
<p>
“My papa! My mamma! I hear them! They’re
not drownd-ed! God didn’t let ’em be lost at sea!”
</p>
<p>
She was out of the room in her nightgown, pattering
in bare feet over the floor. A brown man, with
a beard and twinkling blue eyes, caught her up in
strong arms and hugged her swiftly—safely—to his
breast.
</p>
<p>
“Snuggy!” he said chokingly. “Papa’s Snuggy!”
</p>
<p>
“My baby! My baby!” cried the woman at
whom Joseph Stagg was staring as though he believed
her to be the ghost of his lost sister Hannah.
</p>
<p>
It was several hours later before there was a
really sane thing said or a sane thing done in that
little Harlem flat.
</p>
<p>
“It’s like a lovely fairy story!” cried Carolyn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317'></a>317</span>
May. “Only it’s better than a fairy story—it’s
<em>real</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, it’s real, thank God!” murmured the
happy mother.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m never going away from my little girl
again,” added the father, kissing her for at least the
tenth time.
</p>
<p>
“But what Aunty Rose is going to do, I don’t
see,” said Uncle Joe, shaking his head with real commiseration.
“I’ve sent her a despatch saying that
the child is safe. But if we go back without Hannah’s
Car’lyn——”
</p>
<p>
“The poor soul!” said his sister. “I can believe
that in her secret, subdued way Aunty Rose Kennedy
is entirely wrapped up in Carolyn May. She will
suffer if they are separated for long—and so
abruptly.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” Miss Amanda said gently. “And
Joe will feel it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“I bet I will,” agreed Joseph Stagg. “But I have
you, Mandy. Aunty Rose isn’t going to have anybody.
And for her to go back alone into her old
house—for she won’t stay with us, of course—” he
shook his head dolefully.
</p>
<p>
“Let me write to Aunty Rose,” said Hannah
Cameron briskly. “We want her here. Why, of
course, we do! don’t we, Carolyn May?”
</p>
<p>
“Why!” cried the child delightedly, “that’s just
the way out of it, isn’t it? My! how nice things do
come about in this world, don’t they? Aunty Rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>
shall come here. You’ll like her ever so much, papa.
And Prince will be glad to have her come, for she
always <em>has</em> treated Princey real well.”
</p>
<p>
Prince, who had been standing by with his ears
cocked, yawned, whined, and lay down with a sigh,
as though considering the matter quite satisfactorily
settled.
</p>
<p>
Carolyn May, having climbed up into her father
arms, reached out and drew her mother close beside
her.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
